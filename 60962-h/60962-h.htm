<h2><a name="ACT_I" id="ACT_I"></a>ACT I</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>This is the “living” room of Jerry Frost’s house. It is evening.
The room (and, by implication, the house) is small and stuffy&mdash;it’s
an awful bother to raise these old-fashioned windows; some of them
stick, and besides it’s extravagant to let in much cold air, here
in the middle of March. I can’t say much for the furniture, either.
Some of it’s instalment stuff, imitation leather with the grain
painted on as an after-effect, and some of it’s dingily,
depressingly old. That bookcase held “Ben Hur” when it was a
best-seller, and it’s now trying to digest “A Library of the
World’s Best Literature” and the “Wit and Humor of the United
States in Six Volumes.” That couch would be dangerous to sit upon
without a map showing the location of all craters, hillocks, and
thistle-patches. And three dead but shamefully unburied clocks
stare eyelessly before them from their perches around the walls.</i></p>

<p><i>Those walls&mdash;God! The history of American photography hangs upon
them. Photographs of children with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> puffed dresses and depressing
leers, taken in the Fauntleroy nineties, of babies with toothless
mouths and idiotic eyes, of young men with the hair cuts of ’85 and
’90 and ’02, and with neckties that loop, hoist, snag, or flare in
conformity to some esoteric, antiquated standard of middle-class
dandyism. And the girls! You’d have to laugh at the girls!
Imitation Gibson girls, mostly; you can trace their histories
around the room, as each of them withered and stated. Here’s one in
the look-at-her-little-toes-aren’t-they-darling period, and here
she is later when she was a little bother of ten. Look! This is the
way she was when she was after a husband. She might be worse.
There’s a certain young charm or something, but in the next picture
you can see what five years of general housework have done to her.
You wouldn’t turn your eyes half a degree to watch her in the
street. And that was taken six years ago&mdash;now she’s thirty and
already an old woman.</i></p>

<p><i>You’ve guessed it. That last one, allowing for the photographer’s
kind erasure of a few lines, is Mrs. Jerry Frost. If you listen for
a minute, you’ll hear her, too.</i></p>

<p><i>But wait. Against my will, I’ll have to tell you a few sordid
details about the room. There’s got to be a door in plain sight
that leads directly outdoors, and then there are two other doors,
one to the dining-room and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> to the second floor&mdash;you can see
the beginning of the stairs. Then there’s a window somewhere that’s
used in the last act. I hate to mention these things, but they’re
part of the plot.</i></p>

<p><i>Now you see when the curtain went up, Jerry Frost had left the
little Victrola playing and wandered off to the cellar or
somewhere, and Mrs. Jerry (you can call her Charlotte) hears it
from where she is up-stairs. Listen!</i></p></div>

<p>“Some little bug is going to find you, so-o-ome day!”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That’s her. She hasn’t got much of a voice, has she? And she will
sing one key higher than the Victrola. And now the darn Victrola’s
running down and giving off a ghastly minor discord like the death
agony of a human being.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> [<i>She’s up-stairs, remember.</i>] Jerry, wind up the
graphophone.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>There’s no answer.</i></p></div>

<p>Jer-ry!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Still no answer.</i></p></div>

<p>Jerry, wind up the graphophone. It isn’t good for it.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Yet again no answer.</i></p></div>

<p>All right&mdash; [<i>smugly</i>]&mdash;if you want to ruin it, <i>I</i> don’t care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The phonograph whines, groans, gags, and dies, and almost
simultaneously with its last feeble gesture a man comes into the
room, saying: “What?” He receives no answer. It is Jerry Frost, in
whose home we are.</i></p>

<p><i>Jerry Frost is thirty-five. He is a clerk for the railroad at
$3,000 a year. He possesses no eyebrows, but nevertheless he
constantly tries to knit them. His lips are faintly pursed at all
times, as though about to emit an enormous opinion upon some matter
of great importance.</i></p>

<p><i>On the wall there is a photograph of him at twenty-seven&mdash;just
before he married. Those were the days of his high yellow
pompadour. That is gone now, faded like the rest of him into a
docile pattern without grace or humor.</i></p>

<p><i>After his mysterious and unanswered “What?” Jerry stares at the
carpet, surely not in æsthetic approval, and becomes engrossed in
his lack of thoughts. Suddenly he gives a twitch and tries to reach
with his hand some delicious sector of his back. He can almost
reach it, but not quite&mdash;poor man!&mdash;so he goes to the mantelpiece
and rubs his back gently, pleasingly, against it, meanwhile keeping
his glance focussed darkly upon the carpet.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span></p>

<p><i>He is finished. He is at physical ease again. He leans over the
table&mdash;did I say there was a table?&mdash;and turns the pages of a
magazine, yawning meanwhile and tentatively beginning a slow clog
step with his feet. Presently this distracts him from the magazine,
and he looks apathetically at his feet. Then suddenly he sits in a
chair and begins to sing, unmusically, and with faint interest, a
piece which is possibly his own composition. The tune varies
considerably, but the words have an indisputable consistency, as
they are composed wholly of the phrase: “Everybody is there,
everybody is there!</i>”</p>

<p><i>He is a motion-picture of tremendous, unconscious boredom.</i></p>

<p><i>Suddenly he gives out a harsh, bark-like sound and raises his hand
swiftly, as though he were addressing an audience. This fails to
amuse him; the arm falters, strays lower&mdash;&mdash; </i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Char-<i>lit</i>! Have you got the Saturday Evening Post?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>There is no reply.</i></p></div>

<p>Char-<i>lit</i>!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Still no reply.</i></p></div>

<p>Char-<i>lit</i>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>with syrupy recrimination</i>]. You didn’t bother to answer me,
so I don’t think I should bother to answer you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>indignant, incredulous</i>]. Answer you what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> You know what I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I mos’ certainly do not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I asked you to wind up the graphophone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>glancing at it indignantly</i>]. The phonograph?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Yes, the graphophone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> It’s the first time I knew it. [<i>He is utterly disgusted. He
starts to speak several times, but each time he hesitates. Disgust
settles upon his face, in a heavy pall. Then he remembers his original
question.</i>] Have you got the Saturday Evening Post?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> <i>Yes</i>, I told you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> You did not tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I can’t help it if you’re deaf!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Deaf? Who’s deaf? [<i>After a pause.</i>] No more deaf than you are.
[<i>After another pause.</i>] Not half as much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Don’t talk so loud&mdash;you’ll wake the people next door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>incredulously</i>]. The people next door!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> You heard me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry is beaten, and taking it very badly. He is beginning to
brood when the telephone rings. He answers it.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span>. Hello!... [<i>With recognition and rising interest.</i>] Oh,
hell<i>o</i>.... Did you get the stuff.... Just one gallon is all I want....
No, I can’t use more than one gallon.... [<i>He looks around
thoughtfully.</i>] Yes, I suppose so, but I’d rather have you mix it before
you bring it.... Well, about nine o’clock, then. [<i>He rings off, gleeful
now, smiling. Then sudden worry, and the hairless eyebrows knit
together. He takes a note-book out of his pocket, lays it open before
him, and picks up the receiver.</i>] Midway 9191.... Yes.... Hello, is this
Mr.&mdash;Mr. S-n-o-o-k-s’s residence?... Hello, is this Mr. S-n-o-o-k-s’s
residence?... [<i>Very distinctly.</i>] Mr. Snukes or Snooks.... Mr. S-n-,
the boo&mdash;the fella that gets <i>stuff</i>, hooch ... h-o-o-c-h.... No, Snukes
or Snooks is the man I want.... Oh. Why, a fella down-town gave me your
husband’s name and he called me up&mdash;at least, I called him up first, and
then he called me up just now&mdash;see?... You see? Hello&mdash;is this&mdash;am I
talking to the wife of the&mdash;of the&mdash;of the fella that gets <i>stuff</i> for
you? The b-o-o-t-l-e-g-g-e-r? Oh, you know, the bootlegger. [<i>He
breathes hard after this word. Do you suppose Central will tell on
him?</i>] ... Oh. Well, you see, I wanted to tell him when he comes
to-night to come to the back door.... No, Hooch is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> not my name. My name
is Frost. 2127 Osceola Avenue.... Oh, he’s left already? Oh, all right.
Thanks.... Well, good-by.... Well, good-by ... good-by. [<i>He rings off.
Again his hairless brows are knit with worry.</i>] Char-lit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>abstractedly</i>]. Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Charlit, if you want to read a good story, read the one about the
fella who gets shipwrecked on the Buzzard Islands and meets the Chinese
girl, only she isn’t a Chinese girl at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>she’s still up-stairs, remember</i>]. What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> There’s one story in there&mdash;are you reading the Saturday Evening
Post?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I would be if you didn’t interrupt me every minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I’m not. I just wanted to tell you there’s one story in there
about a Chinese girl who gets wrecked on the Buzzard Islands that isn’t
a Chinese&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, let up, for heaven’s sakes! Don’t nag me.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Clin-n-ng! That’s the door-bell.</i></p></div>

<p>There’s the door-bell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>with fine sarcasm]</i>. Oh, really? Why, I thought it was a
cow-bell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>witheringly</i>]. Ha-ha!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Well, he’s gone to the door. He opens it, mumbles something,
closes it. Now he’s back.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> It wasn’t anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> It must have been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> It couldn’t have rung itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jenny</span> [<i>in disgust</i>]. Oh, gosh, you think that’s funny. [<i>After a
pause.</i>] It was a man who wanted 2145. I told him this was 2127, so he
went away.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Charlotte is now audibly descending a crickety flight of stairs,
and here she is! She’s thirty, and old for her age, just like I
told you, shapeless, slack-cheeked, but still defiant. She would
fiercely resent the statement that her attractions have declined
ninety per cent since her marriage, and in the same breath she
would assume that there was a responsibility and shoulder it on her
husband. She talks in a pessimistic whine and, with a sort of dowdy
egotism, considers herself generally in the right. Frankly, I don’t
like her, though she can’t help being what she is.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I thought you were going to the Republican Convention down at
the Auditorium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, I am. [<i>But he remembers the b-o-o&mdash;.</i>] No, I can’t.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Well, then, for heaven’s sakes don’t spend the evening
sitting here and nagging me. I’m nervous enough as it is.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They both sit. She produces a basket of sewing, selects a man’s
nightshirt and begins, apparently, to rip it to pieces. Meanwhile
Jerry, who has picked up a magazine, regards her out of the corner
of his eye. During the first rip he starts to speak, and again
during the second rip, but each time he restrains himself with a
perceptible effort.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What are you tearing that up for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>sarcastically</i>]. Just for fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Why don’t you tear up one of your own?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>exasperated</i>]. Oh, I know what I’m doing. For heaven’s
sakes, don’t <i>n-a-a-ag</i> me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>feebly</i>]. Well, I just asked you. [<i>A long pause.</i>] Well, I got
analyzed to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I got analyzed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I got analyzed by an expert analyzer. Everybody down at the
Railroad Company got analyzed. [<i>Rather importantly.</i>] They got a chart
about me that long. [<i>He expresses two feet with his hands.</i>] Say&mdash; [<i>He
rises suddenly and goes up close to her.</i>] What color my eyes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Don’t ask me. Sort of brown, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Brown? That’s what I told ’em. But they got me down for blue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What was it all about? Did they pay you anything for it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Pay me anything? Of course not. It was for my benefit. It’ll do
me a lot of good. I was <i>analyzed</i>, can’t you understand? They found out
a lot of stuff about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>dropping her work in horror</i>]. Do you think you’ll lose your
job?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>in disgust</i>]. A lot you know about business methods. Don’t you
ever read “Efficiency” or the “Systematic Weekly”? It’s a sort of
examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, I know. When they feel all the bumps on your head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, not like that at all. They ask you questions, see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Well, you needn’t be so cross about it.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>He hasn’t been cross.</i></p></div>

<p>I hope you had the spunk to tell them you thought you deserved a better
position than you’ve got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> They didn’t ask me things like that. It was up-stairs in one of
the private offices. First the character analyzer looked at me sort of
hard and said “Sit down!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Did you sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Sure; the thing is to do what they tell you. Well, then the
character analyzer asked me my name and whether I was married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>suspiciously</i>]. What did you tell her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Oh, it was a man. I told him yes, of course. What do you think I
am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Well, did he ask you anything else about me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No. He asked me what it was my ambition to be, and I said I
didn’t have any ambition left, and then I said, “Do you mean when I was
a kid?” And he said, “All right, what did you want to do then?” And I
said “Postman,” and he said, “What sort of a job would you like to get
now?” and I said, “Well, what have you got to offer?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Did he offer you a job?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, he was just kidding, I guess. Well, then, he asked me if I’d
ever done any studying at home to fit me for a higher position, and I
said, “Sure,” and he said, “What?” and I couldn’t think of anything
off-hand, so I told him I took music lessons. He said no, he meant about
railroads, and I said they worked me so hard that when I got home at
night I never want to hear about railroads again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Was that all?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Oh, there were some more questions. He asked me if I’d ever been
in jail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What did you tell him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I told him “no,” of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> He probably didn’t believe you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, he asked me a few more things, and then he let me go. I
think I got away with it all right. At least he didn’t give me any black
marks on my chart&mdash;just a lot of little circles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, you got away with it “all right.” That’s all you care.
You got away with it. Satisfied with nothing. Why didn’t you talk right
up to him: “See here, I don’t see why I shouldn’t get more money.”
That’s what you’d have ought to said. He’d of respected you more in the
end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>gloomily</i>]. I did have ambitions once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Ambition to do what? To be a postman. That was a fine
ambition for a fella twenty-two years old. And you’d have been one if
I’d let you. The only other ambition you ever had was to marry me. And
that didn’t last long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I know it didn’t. It lasted one month too long, though.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>A mutual glare here&mdash;let’s not look.</i></p></div>

<p>And I’ve had other ambitions since then&mdash;don’t you worry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Oh, that’s all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What, though? I’d like to know what. To win five dollars
playing dice in a cigar store?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Never you mind. Don’t you worry. Don’t you fret. It’s all right,
see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> You’re afraid to tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, I’m not. Don’t you worry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Yes, you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> All right then. If you want to know, I had an ambition to be
President of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Ho&mdash;<i>ho</i>&mdash;ho&mdash;<i>ho</i>!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry is pretending to be interested only in sucking his
teeth&mdash;but you can see that he is both sorry he made his admission
and increasingly aware that his wife is being unpleasant.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> But you decided to give that up, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Sure. I gave up everything when I got married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Even gave up being a postman, eh? That’s right. Blame it all
on me! Why, if it hadn’t been for me you wouldn’t even be what you
are&mdash;a fifty-dollar-a-week clerk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> That’s right. I’m only a fifty-dollar-a-week clerk. But you’re
only a thirty-dollar-a-week wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, I am, am I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I made a big mistake when I married you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Stop talking like that! I wish you were dead&mdash;dead and
buried&mdash;cremated! Then I could have some fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Where&mdash;in the poorhouse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> That’s where I’d be, I know.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Charlotte is not really very angry. She is merely smug and
self-satisfied, you see, and is only mildly annoyed at this
unexpected resistance to her brow-beating. She knows that Jerry
will always stay and slave for her. She has begun this row as a
sort of vaudeville to assuage her nightly boredom.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Why didn’t you think of these things before we got married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I did, a couple of times, but you had me all signed up then.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The sound of uncertain steps creaking down the second floor. Into
the room at a wavering gait comes Jerry’s father, Horatio&mdash;“Dada.”</i></p>

<p><i>Dada was born in 1834, and will never see eighty-eight again&mdash;in
fact, his gathering blindness prevented him from seeing it very
clearly in the first place. Originally he was probably Jerry’s
superior in initiative, but he did not prosper, and during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span>
past twenty years his mind has been steadily failing. A Civil War
pension has kept him quasi-independent, and he looks down as from a
great dim height upon Jerry (whom he thinks of as an adolescent)
and Charlotte (whom he rather dislikes). Never given to reading in
his youth, he has lately become absorbed in the Old Testament and
in all Old Testament literature, over which he burrows every day in
the Public Library.</i></p>

<p><i>In person he is a small, shrivelled man with a great amount of
hair on his face, which gives him an unmistakable resemblance to a
French poodle. The fact that he is almost blind and even more
nearly deaf contributes to his aloof, judicial pose, and to the
prevailing impression that something grave and thoughtful and
important is going on back of those faded, vacant eyes. This
conception is entirely erroneous. Half the time his mind is a
vacuum, in which confused clots of information and misinformation
drift and stir&mdash;the rest of the time he broods upon the minute
details of his daily existence. He is too old, even, for the petty
spites which represent to the aged the single gesture of vitality
they can make against the ever-increasing pressure of life and
youth.</i></p>

<p><i>When he enters the room he looks neither to left nor right, but
with his head shaking faintly and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> mouth moving in a shorter
vibration, makes directly for the bookcase.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Hello, Dada.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Dada does not hear.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>louder</i>]. Looking for the Bible, Dada?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> [<i>He has reached the bookcase, and he turns around stiffly.</i>] I’m
not deaf, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> [<i>Let’s draw the old man out.</i>] Who do you think will be
nominated for President, Dada?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>trying to pretend he has just missed one word</i>]. The&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>louder</i>]. Who do you think’ll be nominated for President,
to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> I should say that Lincoln was our greatest President. [<i>He turns
back to the bookcase with an air of having settled a trivial question
for all time.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I mean to-night. They’re getting a new one. Don’t you read the
papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>who has heard only a faint murmur</i>]. Hm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> You <i>know</i> he never reads anything but the Bible. Why do you
nag him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> He reads the encyclopædia at the Public Library. [<i>With a rush of
public spirit.</i>] If he’d just read the newspapers he’d know what was
going on and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> have something to talk about. He just sits around and
never says anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> At least he doesn’t gabble his head off all day. He’s got
sense enough not to do that <i>any</i>way, haven’t you, Dada?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Dada does not answer.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Lookit here, Charlit. I don’t call it gabbling if I meet a man in
the street and he says, “Well, I see somebody was nominated for
President,” and I say, “Yes, I see saw&mdash;see so.” Suppose I said, “Yes,
Lincoln was our greatest President.” He’d say, “Why, if that fella isn’t
a piece of cheese I never saw a piece of cheese.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>turning about plaintively</i>]. Some one has taken my Bible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, there it is on the second shelf, Dada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> [<i>He doesn’t hear.</i>] I don’t like people moving it around.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Nobody moved it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> My old mother used to say to me, “Horatio&mdash;” [<i>He brings this word
out with an impressive roundness, but as his eye, at that moment,
catches sight of the Bible, he loses track of his thought. He pounces
upon the Holy Book and drags it out, pulling with it two or three other
books, which crash to the floor. The sound of their fall is very faint
on his ears&mdash;and under the delusion that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> error is unnoticed, he
slyly kicks the books under the bookcase. Jerry and Charlotte exchange a
glance. With his Bible under his arm Dada starts stealthily toward the
staircase. He sees something bright shining on the first step, and, not
without difficulty, stoops to pick it up. His efforts are
unsuccessful.</i>] Hello, here’s a nail that looks just like a ten-cent
piece. [<i>He starts up-stairs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> He thought he found a ten-cent piece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>significantly</i>]. Nobody has yet in <i>this</i> house.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>In the ensuing silence Dada can be heard ascending the stairs.
About half-way up there is a noise as if he had slipped down a
notch. Then a moment of utter silence.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> You all right, Dada?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>No answer. Dada is heard to resume his climb.</i></p></div>

<p>He was just resting. [<i>He goes over and starts picking up the books.
Cli-n-ng! There’s the front door-bell again. It occurs to him that it’s
the b-o-o.</i>] I’ll answer it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>who has risen</i>]. <i>I’ll</i> answer it. It’s my own sister Doris,
I <i>know</i>. You answered the last one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> That was a mistake. It’s my turn this time by rights.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Answering the door-bell is evidently a pleasant diversion over
which they have squabbled before.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I’ll answer it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> You needn’t bother.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Cli-n-ng! An impatient ring that.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte and Jerry</span> [<i>together</i>]. Now, listen here&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They both start for the door. Jerry turns, only trying to argue
with her some more, and what does the woman do but slap his face!
Then, quick as a flash, she is by him and has opened the door.</i></p>

<p><i>What do you think of that? Jerry stands there with an
expressionless face. In comes Charlotte’s sister Doris.</i></p>

<p><i>Well, now, I’ll tell you about Doris. She’s nineteen, I guess, and
pretty. She’s nice and slender and dressed in an astonishingly
close burlesque of the current fashions. She’s a member of that
portion of the middle-class whose girls are just a little bit too
proud to work and just a little bit too needy not to. In this city
of perhaps a quarter of a million people she knows a few girls who
know a few girls who are “social leaders,” and through this
connection considers herself a member of the local aristocracy. In
her mind, morals, and manners she is a fairly capable imitation of
the current moving-picture girl, with overtones of some of the
year’s débutantes whom she sees down-town. Doris knows each
débutante’s first name and reputation, and she follows the vari<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span>ous
affairs of the season as they appear in the society column.</i></p>

<p><i>She walks&mdash;walks, not runs&mdash;haughtily into the room, her head
inclined faintly forward, her hips motionless. She speaks always in
a bored voice, raising her eyebrows at the important words of each
sentence.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Hello, people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>a little stiffly&mdash;he’s mad</i>.] Why, hello, Doris.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Doris sits down with a faint glance at her chair, as though
suspecting its chastity.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, I’m engaged again.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She says this as though realizing that she is the one contact this
couple have with the wider and outer world. She assumes with almost
audible condescension that their only objective interest is the
fascinating spectacle of her career. And so there is nothing
personal in her confidences; it is as though she were reporting
dispassionately an affair of great national, or, rather, passional
importance. And, indeed, Jerry and Charlotte respond magnificently
to her initial remark by saying “Honestly?” in incredulous unison
and staring at her with almost bated breath.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>laconically</i>]. Last night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>reproachfully</i>]. Oh, Doris! [<i>flattering her, you see, by
accusing her of being utterly incorrigible</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I simply couldn’t help it. I couldn’t stand him any longer, and
this new fella I’m engaged to now simply had to know&mdash;because he was
keeping some girl waiting. I just couldn’t stand it. The strain was
awful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Why couldn’t you stand it? What was the trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>coolly</i>]. He drank.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Charlotte, of course, shakes her head in sympathy.</i></p></div>

<p>He’d drink anything. Anything he could get his hands on. He used to
drink all these mixtures and then come round to see me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A close observer might notice that at this statement Jerry,
thinking of his nefarious bargain with the b-o-o, perceptibly
winces.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, that’s too bad. He was such a clean-cut fella.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Yes, Charlotte, he was clean-cut, but that was all. I couldn’t
stand it, honestly I couldn’t. I never saw such a man, Charlotte. He
took the platinum sardine. When they go up in your room and steal your
six-dollar-an-ounce perfume, a girl’s got to let a man go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I should say she has. What did he say when you broke it off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He couldn’t say anything. He was too pie-eyed. I tied his ring on
a string, hung it around his neck and pushed him out the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Who’s the new one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, to tell you the truth, I don’t know much about him, but
I’ll tell you what I <i>do</i> know from what information I could gather from
mutual friends, and so forth. He’s not quite so clean-cut as the first
one, but he’s got lots of other good qualities. He comes from the State
of Idaho, from a town named Fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Fish? F-i-s-h?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I think so. It was named after his uncle ... a Mr. Fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>wittily</i>]. They’re a lot of Fish out there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>not comprehending</i>]. Well, these Fishes are very nice. They’ve
been mayor a couple of times and all that sort of thing, if you know
what I mean. His father’s in business up there now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He’s in the funereal-parlor business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>indelicately</i>]. Oh, undertaker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> [<i>She’s sensitive to the word.</i>] Well, not exactly, but something
like that. A funereal parlor is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> sort of&mdash;oh, a sort of a <i>good</i>
undertaking place, if you know what I mean. [<i>And now confidentially.</i>]
As a matter of fact, that’s the part of the thing I don’t like. You see,
we may have to live out in Fish, right over his father’s place of
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Why, that’s all right. Think how handy it’ll be if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Keep still, Jerry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Is he in the same business as his father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> No. At least not now. He was for a while, but the business wasn’t
very good and now he says he’s through with it. His father’s bought him
an interest in one of the stores.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> A Fish store, eh?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>The two women look at him harshly.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>wriggling her shoulders with enjoyment</i>]. Tell us more about
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, he’s wonderful looking. And he dresses, well, not loud, you
know, but just <i>well</i>. And when anybody speaks to him he goes sort
of&mdash; [<i>To express what Mr. Fish does when any one speaks to him, Doris
turns her profile sharply to the audience, her chin up, her eyes
half-closed in an expression of melancholy scorn.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I know&mdash;like Rudolph Valentine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>witheringly&mdash;do you blame her?</i>]. Valentino.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What does it mean when he does that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I don’t know, just sort of&mdash;sort of passion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Passion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Emotion sort of. He’s very emotional. That’s one reason I didn’t
like the last fella I was engaged to. He wasn’t very emotional. He was
sort of an old cow most of the time. I’ve got to have somebody
emotional. You remember that place in the Sheik where the fella says:
“Must I play valet as well as lover?” That’s the sort of thing I like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>darting a look at Jerry</i>]. I know <i>just</i> what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He’s not really as tall as I’d like him to be, but he’s got a
wonderful build and a good complexion. I can’t stand anybody without a
good complexion&mdash;can you? He calls me adorable egg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What does he mean by that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>airily</i>]. Oh, “egg” is just a name people use nowadays. It’s
considered sort of the thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>awed</i>]. Egg?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> When do you expect to get married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> You never can tell!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A pause, during which they all sigh as if pondering. Then Doris,
with a tremendous effort at justice, switches the conversation away
from herself.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>patronizingly, condescendingly</i>]. How’s everything going with
you two? [<i>To Jerry.</i>] Does your father still read the Bible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, a lot of the time he just thinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He hasn’t had anything to do for the last twenty years but just
think, has he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>impressed</i>]. Just think of the things he’s probably thought out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>blasphemously</i>]. That old dumb-bell?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Charlotte and Jerry are a little shocked.</i></p></div>

<p>How’s everything else been going around here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I got analyzed to-day at&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>interrupting</i>]. The same as ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I got anal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>to Jerry</i>]. I wish you’d be polite enough not to interrupt
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>pathetically</i>]. I thought you were through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Well, you’ve driven what I had to say right out of my head.
[<i>To Doris.</i>] What do you think he said to-night? He said if he hadn’t
married me he’d be President of the United States.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>At this Jerry drops his newspaper precipitately, walks in anger to
the door, and goes out without speaking.</i></p></div>

<p>You see? Just a display of temper. But it doesn’t worry <i>me</i>. [<i>She
sighs&mdash;the shrew.</i>] I’m used to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Doris tactfully makes no reply. After a momentary silence she
changes the subject.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, I find I just made an awful mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>eagerly</i>]. Not keeping both those men for a while? That’s
what I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> No. I mean&mdash;do you remember those three dresses I had lengthened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>breathlessly</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>tragically</i>]. I’ll never be able to wear them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> There’s a picture of Mae Murray in the new Motion Picture
Magazine ... my dear, half her calf!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Really?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>At this point the door leading to the dining-room opens and Jerry

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It was just my luck. I wish I’d hemmed them like I thought of

he jumps as Doris speaks to him.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>morosely dignified</i>]. What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>with real interest</i>]. What makes you think you could be
President?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Charlotte</i>]. That’s right. Make a fool of me in front of all
your relations! [<i>In his excitement he bangs down his paper upon a

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I haven’t said one word&mdash;not one single solitary word&mdash;have
I, Doris?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jerry goes out hastily&mdash;without his paper!</i></p></div>

<p>Did I say one word, Doris? I’ll leave it to you. Did I say one single
word to bring down all that uproar on my head? To have him <i>swear</i> at
me?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry, crimson in the face, comes in, snatches up his forgotten
paper, and rushes wildly out again.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span></p>

<p>He’s been nagging at me all evening. He said I kept him from doing
everything he wanted to. And you know very well, Doris, he’d have been a
postman if it hadn’t been for me. He said he wished I was dead.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>It seems to me it was Charlotte who wished Jerry was dead!</i></p></div>

<p>He said he could get a better wife than me for thirty dollars a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>fascinated</i>]. Did he really? Where did he say he could get her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> That’s the sort of man <i>he</i> is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He’d never be rich if you <i>gave</i> him the money. He hasn’t got any
<i>push</i>. I think a man’s got to have <i>push</i>, don’t you? I mean sort of
<i>uh</i>! [<i>She gives a little grunt to express indomitable energy, and
makes a sharp gesture with her hand.</i>] I saw in the paper about a fella
that didn’t have any legs or arms forty years old that was a
millionaire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Maybe if Jerry didn’t have any legs or arms he’d do better.
How did this fella make it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I forget. Some scheme. He just thought of a scheme. That’s the
thing, you know&mdash;to think of some scheme. Some kind of cold cream or
hair&mdash;say, I wish somebody’d invent some kind of henna that nobody could
tell. Maybe Jerry could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> He hasn’t brains enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Say, I saw a wonderful dog to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What kind of a dog?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It was out walking with Mrs. Richard Barton Hammond on Crest
Avenue. It was pink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Pink! I never saw a pink dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Neither did I before. Gosh, it was cunning.... Well, I got to go.
My fiancé is coming over at quarter to nine and we’re going down to the
theatre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Why don’t you bring him over some time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> All right. I’ll bring him over after the movies if you’ll be up.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They walk together to the door. Doris goes out and Charlotte has
scarcely shut the door behind her when the bell rings again.
Charlotte opens the door and then retreats half-way across the
room, with an alarmed expression on her face. A man has come in,
with a great gunny-sack slung over his shoulder. It is none other
than Mr. Snooks or Snukes, the bootlegger.</i></p>

<p><i>I wish I could introduce you to the original from whom I have
taken Mr. Snooks. He is as villainous-looking a man as could be
found in a year’s search. He has a weak chin, a broken nose, a
squint<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> eye, and a three days’ growth of beard. If you can imagine
a race-track sport who has fallen in a pool of mud you can get an
idea of his attire. His face and hands are incrusted with dirt. He
lacks one prominent tooth, lacks it with a vulgar and somehow awful
conspicuousness. His most ingratiating smile is a criminal leer,
his eyes shift here and there upon the carpet, as he speaks in a
villainous whine.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>uneasily</i>]. What do you want?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mr. Snooks leers and winks broadly, whereat Charlotte bumps back
against the bookcase.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>hoarsely</i>]. Tell your husband Sandy Claus is here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>calling nervously</i>]. Jerry, here’s somebody wants to see
you. He says he’s&mdash;he’s Santa Claus.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>In comes Jerry. He sees the situation, but the appearance of the
b-o-o evidently shocks him, and a wave of uneasiness passes over
him. Nevertheless, he covers up these feelings with a magnificent
nonchalance.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Oh, yes. How de do? How are you? Glad to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>wiggling the bag, which gives out a loud, glassy clank</i>]. Hear
it talking to you, eh?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Charlotte looks from one to the other of them darkly.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> It’s all right, Charlit. I’ll tend to it. You go up-stairs. You
go upstairs and read that&mdash;there’s a story in the Saturday Evening Post
about a Chinese girl on the Buzzard Islands that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I know. Who isn’t a Chinese girl. Never mind that. I’ll stay
right here.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry turns from her with the air of one who has done his

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Snooks</i>]. Is this Mr. Snukes? Or Snooks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Snooks. Funny name, ain’t it? I made it up. I got it off a can
of tomatoes. I’m an Irish-Pole by rights. [<i>Meanwhile he has been
emptying the sack of its contents and setting them on the table. First
come two one-gallon jars, one full, the other empty. Then a square,
unopened one-gallon can. Finally three small bottles and a medicine
dropper.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>in dawning horror</i>]. What’s that? A still?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>with a wink at Jerry</i>]. No, lady, this here’s a wine-press.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> [<i>He’s attempting to conciliate her.</i>] No, no, Charlit. Listen.
This gentleman here is going to make me some gin&mdash;very, very cheap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Some gin!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Yes, for cocktails.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> For whose cocktails?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> For you and me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Do you think <i>I’d</i> take one of the poison things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Snooks</i>]. They’re not poison, are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Poison! Say, lady, I’d be croaked off long ago if they was. I’d
be up wid de angels! This ain’t <i>wood</i> alcohol. This is <i>grain</i> alcohol.
[<i>He holds up the gallon can, on which is the following label</i>]:</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. Why, it says wood alcohol right on the can!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Yes, but it ain’t. I just use a wood-alcohol can, so in case I
get caught. You’re allowed to sell wood alcohol, see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>explaining to Charlotte</i>]. Just in case he gets caught&mdash;see?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I think the whole performance is perfectly terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, it isn’t. Mr. Snooks has sold this to some of the swellest
families in the city&mdash;haven’t you, Mr. Snooks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Sure. You know old man Alec Martin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>glancing at Charlotte, who is stony-eyed</i>]. Sure. Everybody
knows who <i>they</i> are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> I sole ’em a gallon. And John B. Standish? I sole him five
gallons and he said it was the best stuff he ever tasted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Charlotte</i>]. See&mdash;? The swellest people in town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> I’d a got here sooner, only I got double crossed to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> A fella down-town sold me out to the rev’nue officers. I got
stuck for two thousand dollars and four cases Haig and Haig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Gee, that’s too bad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Aw, you never know who’s straight in this game. They’ll double
cross you in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Who sold you out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> A fella. What do you suppose he got for it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Ten dollars. What do you know about a fella that’d sell a guy
out for ten dollars? I just went right up to him and said: “Why, you
Ga&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Say, don’t tell us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Well, I told him where he got off at, anyways. And then I
plastered him one. An’ the rev’nue officers jus’ stood there and
laughed. My brother ’n I are goin’ ’round an’ beat him up again tomorra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>righteously</i>]. He certainly deserved it.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>A pause.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>after a moment’s brooding</i>]. Well, I’ll fix this up for you
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>stiffly</i>]. How much is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> This? Sixteen a gallon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>eagerly</i>]. See, that makes two gallons of the stuff, Charlotte,
and that’s eight quarts, and eight quarts of the stuff makes sixteen
quarts of cocktails. That’s enough to last us&mdash;oh, three years anyhow.
Just think how nice it’ll be if anybody comes in. Just say: “Like a
little cocktail?” “Sure.” “All right.” [<i>He makes a noise to express
orange squeezing.</i>] Oranges! [<i>A noise to express the cracking of ice.</i>]
Ice! [<i>A noise to express the sound of a shaker.</i>] Shaker! [<i>He pours

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>contemptuously</i>]. Well, I think you’re a little crazy, if
you ask me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>taking off his hat and coat</i>]. You got a big bowl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> No. Why didn’t you bring your own bowl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>uncertainly</i>]. There’s a nice big bowl in the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> All right. Go on and spoil all the kitchen things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I’ll wash it afterward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Wash it? [<i>She laughs contemptuously, implying that washing
will do it no good then. Jerry, nevertheless, goes for the bowl. He
feels pretty guilty by this time, but he’s going through with it now,
even though he may never hear the last of it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>hollering after him</i>]. Get a corkscrew, too. [<i>He holds up the
tin can to Charlotte.</i>] Grain alcohol. [<i>Charlotte’s lips curl in
answer. He holds up a small bottle.</i>] Spirits of Jupiter. One drop of
this will smell up a whole house for a week. [<i>He holds up a second
bottle.</i>] Oila Aniseed. Give it a flavor. Take the arsenic out. [<i>He
holds up a third bottle.</i>] Oila Coreander.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>sardonically</i>]. Wouldn’t you like me to look in the
medicine-chest and see if there’s something<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> there you could use? Maybe
you need some iodine. Or some of Dada’s ankle-strengthener.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jerry comes in, laden.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Here’s the bowl and the corkscrew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> You forgot the salt and pepper.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Amid great pounding the bootlegger breaks the corkscrew on the tin

<p>You’ll have to stop coughing. You’ll wake the people next door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Or a scissors?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Say, what kind of a house is this? [<i>He finally manages to open
the can.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> [<i>With some pride.</i>] Grain alcohol. Costs me $6.00 a gallon.
[<i>To Charlotte.</i>] Smell it.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>She retreats from it hastily.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I can smell <i>some</i>thing horrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> That’s the spirits of Jupiter. I haven’t opened it yet. It rots
a cork in ten days. [<i>He fills the bowl with water from one jar.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>anxiously</i>]. Hadn’t you better measure it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> I got my eye trained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What’s that&mdash;arsenic?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Distilled water, lady. If you use regular water it gets cloudy.
You want it clear. [<i>He pours in alcohol from the can.</i>] Got a spoon?...
Well, never mind. [<i>He rolls up his sleeve and undoubtedly intends to
plunge his whole arm into the mixture.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. Here! Wait a minute. No use&mdash;no use getting your hand
wet. I’ll get you a spoon. [<i>He goes after it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>sarcastically</i>]. Get one of the best silver ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Naw. Any kind’ll do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> It won’t hurt it, lady. Just leave it out in the sun for an
hour. Now the spirits of Jupiter. [<i>He fills the medicine dropper from a
small bottle and lets a slow, interminable procession of drops fall into
the bowl. Jerry watches intently and with gathering anxiety. At about
the fourteenth drop he starts every time one falls. Finally Mr. Snooks
ceases.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> How many did you count?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Sixteen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I counted eighteen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Well, a drop or so won’t make no difference. Now you got a
funnel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I’ll get one. [<i>He goes for it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Good stuff, lady. This is as good as what you used to buy for
the real thing.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Charlotte does not deign to answer.</i></p></div>

<p>You needn’t worry about that spoon. If that spoon had a been the real
thing it w’na done like that. You can try out all your stuff that way. A
lot of stuff is sold for silver nowadays that ain’t at all.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry returns with the funnel, and Mr. Snooks pours the contents
of the bowl into the two glass jars.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>holding up one jar admiringly</i>]. The real thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> It’s cloudy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>reproachfully</i>]. Cloudy? You call that cloudy? That isn’t
cloudy. Why, it’s just as clear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He holds it up and pretends to look through it. This is

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Lady, if this was the last liquor in the world it wouldn’t be

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>doubtfully</i>]. It does look a little&mdash;cloudy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> No-o-o&mdash;! Why you can see right through it. [<i>He fills a glass

nervous matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte and Jerry</span> [<i>together</i>]. Nervous matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> When did we put that in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> We didn’t put it in. It’s just a deposit. Sure, that’s just
nervous matter. Any chemis’ will tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>sardonically</i>]. Ha-ha! “Nervous matter.” There’s no such
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Sure! That’s just nervous matter. [<i>He fills the glass and hands

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>bravely</i>]. No. She doesn’t care what I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> You ought to give her a bat in the eye now and then. That’d fix
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>shocked</i>]. Oh, no; you oughtn’t to talk that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> “Frosts,” you see. We’re not rich, but I always say that it’s

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> <i>No!</i> How many times do I have to tell you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>crestfallen</i>]. Well, you don’t need to be so disagreeable about
it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He receives no answer. He would like to talk some more, but he
shuts the door and returns to the table. Picking up one of the
jars, he regards its opaqueness with a quizzical eye. But it is his
and quite evidently it seems to him good. He looks curiously at the
three little bottles, smells one of them curiously and hastily
replaces the cork. He hesitates. Then he repairs to the
dining-room, singing: “Everybody is there!”&mdash;and returns
immediately with an orange, a knife, and another glass. He cuts the
orange, squeezes half of it into a glass, wipes his hands on the
fringe of the tablecloth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> adds some of his liquor. He drinks
it slowly&mdash;he waits. He prepares another potation with the other
half of the orange.</i></p>

<p><i>No! He does not choke, make horrible faces, nor feel his throat as
it goes down. Nor does he stagger. His elation is evinced only by
the vague confusion with which he mislays knife, oranges, and
glasses.</i></p>

<p><i>Impelled by the gregarious instinct of mankind, he again repairs
to the door that leads up-stairs, and opens it.</i></p></div>

<h2><a name="ACT_II" id="ACT_II"></a>ACT II</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Any one who felt that the first Act was perhaps a little vulgar,
will be glad to learn that we’re now on the lawn of the White
House. Indeed, a corner of the Executive Mansion projects
magnificently into sight, and steps lead up to the imposing
swinging doors of a “Family Entrance.” From the window of the
President’s office a flag flutters, and the awning displays this
legend</i>:</p>

<p class="c">
<span class="smcap">The White House<br />
<br />
Jerry Frost, Pres.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>And if you look hard enough at the office window you can see the
President himself sitting at his desk inside.</i></p>

<p><i>The lawn, bounded by a white brick wall, is no less attractive.
Not only are there white vines and flowers, a beautiful white tree,
and a white table and chairs, but, also, a large sign over the
gate, which bears the President’s name pricked out in electric
bulbs.</i></p>

<p><i>Two white kittens are strolling along the wall, enjoying the
ten-o’clock sunshine. A blond parrot swings in a cage over the
table, and one of the chairs is at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> occupied by a white
fox-terrier puppy about the size of your hand.</i></p>

<p><i>That’s right. “Isn’t it darling!” We’ll let you watch it for a
moment before we move into the Whirl of Public Affairs.</i></p>

<p><i>Look! Here comes somebody out. It’s Mr. Jones, the well-known
politician, now secretary to President Frost. He has a white broom
in his hands, and, after delighting the puppy with an absolutely
white bone, he begins to sweep off the White House steps. At this
point the gate swings open and Charlotte Frost comes in. As befits
the first Lady of the Land, she is elaborately dressed&mdash;in the
height of many fashions. She’s evidently been shopping&mdash;her arms
are full of packages&mdash;but she has nevertheless seen fit to array
herself in a gorgeous evening dress, with an interminable train.
From her wide picture hat a plume dangles almost to the ground.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Jones politely relieves her of her bundles.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>abruptly</i>]. Good morning, Mr. Jones. Has everything gone to
pieces?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Mr. Jones looks her over in some surprise.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span> [<i>apologetically</i>]. Well, perhaps the petticoat&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>a little stiffly</i>]. I didn’t mention myself, I don’t think,
Mr. Jones. I meant all my husband’s public affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> He’s been in his office all morning, Mrs. Frost. There are a lot
of people waiting to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> [<i>She’s relieved.</i>] I heard them calling an extra, and I
thought maybe everything had gone to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> No, Mrs. Frost, the President hasn’t made any bad mistake for
some time now. Of course, a lot of people objected when he appointed his
father Secretary of the Treasury; his father’s being so old&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Well, I’ve had to stand for his family all my life&mdash;so I
guess the country can. [<i>Confidentially.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span> [<i>a little embarrassed</i>]. I see you’ve been shopping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I’ve been buying some things for my sister’s wedding
reception this afternoon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The window of President Frost’s office opens abruptly. A white
cigar emerges&mdash;followed by Jerry’s hairless eyebrows&mdash;passionately
knit.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> All right. Go on and yell&mdash;and then when I make some awful
mistake and the country goes to pieces, blame it on me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>very patiently</i>]. Nagging me again. Picking on me.
Pick&mdash;pick&mdash;pick! All day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Gosh, you can be disagreeable, Charlit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Pick&mdash;pick&mdash;pick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>confused</i>]. Pick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>sharply</i>]. Pick!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jerry jams down his window.</i></p>

<p><i>Meanwhile from the window above has emerged a hand holding a
mirror. The hand is presently followed by a head with the hair
slicked back damply. Doris, sister-in-law to the President, is
seeking more light for her afternoon toilet.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>disapprovingly</i>]. I can hear you two washing your clothes in
public all over the lawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> He keeps nagging at me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Doris begins to apply a white lotion to her face. She daubs it at
a freckle on her nose, and gazes passionately at the resultant
white splotch.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>abstractedly</i>]. I should think you’d get so you could stand him
in public, anyways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> He makes me madder in public than anywhere else.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She gathers her bundles and goes angrily into the White House.
Doris glances down at Mr. Jones, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span> deciding hastily that she is
too publicly placid, withdraws her person from sight.</i></p>

<p><i>Jones picks up his broom and is about to go inside when a
uniformed chauffeur opens the gate and announces:</i></p></div>

<p>“The Honorable Joseph Fish, Senator from Idaho.”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>And now here’s Joseph Fish, in an enormous frock-coat and a tall
silk hat, radiating an air of appalling prosperity.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Good morning, Mr. Jones. Is my fiancée around?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> I believe she’s in her boudoir, Senator Fish. How is everything
down at the capital?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>gloomily</i>]. Awful! I’m in a terrible position, Mr. Jones&mdash;and
this was to have been my wedding reception day. Listen to this. [<i>He
takes a telegram from his pocket.</i>] “Senator Joseph Fish, Washington, D.
C. Present the State of Idaho’s compliments to President Frost and tell
him that the people of Idaho demand his immediate resignation.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> This is terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> It’s because he made his father Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> This will be depressing news to the President.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> But think of <i>me</i>! This was to have been my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> wedding reception
day. What will Doris say when she hears about this. I’ve got to ask her
own brother-in-law to&mdash;to move out of his home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Have a cocktail.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He takes a shaker and glasses from behind a porch pillar and pours
out two drinks.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> I saw this coming. But I’ll tell you now, Senator Fish, the
President won’t resign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Then it’ll be my duty to have him impeached.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Shall I call the President now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Let’s wait until eleven o’clock. Give me one more hour of
happiness. [<i>He raises his eyes pathetically to the upper window.</i>]
Doris&mdash;oh Doris!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Doris, now fully dressed and under the influence of cosmetics,
comes out onto the lawn. Mr. Jones, picking up the broom and the
puppy, goes into the White House.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>jealously</i>]. Where were you all day yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>languidly</i>]. An old beau of mine came to see me and kept hanging
around.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>in wild alarm</i>]. Good God! What’d he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He said I was stuck up because my brother-in-law was President,
and I said: “Well, what if I am? I’d hate to say what your
brother-in-law is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>fascinated</i>]. What is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He owns a garbage disposal service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>even more fascinated</i>]. Is that right? Can you notice it on his
brother-in-law?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Something awful. I wouldn’t of let him come in the house. Imagine
if somebody came in to see you and said: “Sniff. Sniff. Who’s been
sitting on these chairs?” And you said: “Oh, just my brother-in-law, the
garbage disposal man.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Doris&mdash;Doris, an awful thing has occurred&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>looking out the gate</i>]. Here comes Dada. Say, he must be going
on to between eighty and ninety years old, if not older.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>gloomily</i>]. Why did your brother-in-law have to go and make him
Secretary of the Treasury? He might as well have gone to an old men’s
home and said: “See here, I want to get eight old dumb-bells for my
cabinet.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Oh, Jerry does everything all wrong. You see, he thought his
father had read a lot of books&mdash;the Bible and the Encyclopædia and the
Dictionary and all.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>In totters Dada. Prosperity has spruced him up, but not to any
alarming extent. The hair on his face is not under cultivation. His

by the moon.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Good morning, Mr. Frost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>dimly</i>]. Hm.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>He is under the impression that he has made an adequate response.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>tolerantly</i>]. Dada, kindly meet my fiancé&mdash;Senator Fish from
Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>expansively</i>]. Young man, how do you do? I feel very well. You
wouldn’t think I was eighty-eight years old, would you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>politely</i>]. I should say not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> You’d think he was two hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>who missed this</i>]. Yeah. [<i>A long pause.</i>] We used to have a joke
when I was young&mdash;we used to say the first Frosts came to this country
in the beginning of winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Funny as a crutch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>to Fish</i>]. Do you ever read the Scriptures?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> I’m the Secretary of the Treasury, you know. My son made me the
Secretary of the Treasury. He’s the President. He was my only boy by my
second wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> The old dumb-bell!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> I was born in 1834, under the presidency of Andrew Jackson. I was
twenty-seven years old when the war broke out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>sarcastically</i>]. Do you mean the Revolutionary War?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>witheringly</i>]. The Revolutionary War was in 1776.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Tell me something I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> When you grow older you’ll find there are a lot of things you
don’t know. [<i>To Fish.</i>] Do you know my son Jerry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>utterly disgusted</i>]. Oh, gosh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> I met your son before he was elected President and I’ve seen him a
lot of times since then, on account of being Senator from Idaho and all,
and on account of Doris. You see, we’re going to have our wedding
reception this afternoon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>In the middle of this speech Dada’s mind has begun to wander. He
utters a vague “Hm!” and moves off, paying no further attention,
and passing through the swinging doors into the White House.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>impressed in spite of himself by Dada’s great age</i>]. He’s
probably had a lot of experience, that old bird. He was alive before you
were born.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> So were a lot of other old nuts. Come on&mdash;let’s go hire the music
for our wedding reception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>remembering something with a start</i>]. Doris&mdash;Doris, would you
have a wedding reception with me if you knew&mdash;if you knew the
disagreeable duty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Knew what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Nothing. I’m going to be happy, anyways [<i>he looks at his

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>They go out through the garden gate.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Well, I just thought I’d tell you&mdash;so you could think about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>hopefully</i>]. Maybe I’ll get some idea how to fix it up. I’m a
very resourceful man. I always think of something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Mr. President, would you&mdash;would you mind telling me how you got
your start?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>carelessly</i>]. Oh, I got analyzed one day, and they just found I
was sort of a good man and would just be wasting my time as a railroad
clerk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> So you forged ahead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Sure. I just made up my mind to be President, and then I went
ahead and did it. I’ve always been a very ambitious sort of&mdash;sort of
domineerer.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jones sighs and takes several letters from his pocket.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> The morning mail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>looking at the first letter</i>]. This one’s an ad, I’ll bet. [<i>He
opens it.</i>] “Expert mechanics, chauffeurs, plumbers earn big money. We
fit you in twelve lessons.” [<i>He looks up.</i>] I wonder if there’s
anything personal in that. If there is it’s a low sort of joke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]. Oh, I don’t think there is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>offended</i>]. Anybody that’d play a joke like that on a person
that has all the responsibility of being President, and then to have
somebody play a low, mean joke on him like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> I’ll write them a disagreeable letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> All right. But make it sort of careless, as if it didn’t matter
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> I can begin the letter “Damn Sirs” instead of “Dear Sirs.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Sure, that’s the idea. And put something like that in the ending,
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> “Yours insincerely,” or something like that.... Now there’s a few
people waiting in here to see you, sir. [<i>He takes out a list.</i>] First,
there’s somebody that’s been ordered to be hung.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What about him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> I think he wants to arrange it some way so he won’t be hung. Then
there’s a man that’s got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span> scheme for changing everybody in the United
States green.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]. Green?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> That’s what he says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Why green?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> He didn’t say. I told him not to wait. And there’s the Ambassador
from Abyssinia. He says that one of our sailors on leave in Abyssinia
threw the king’s cousin down a flight of thirty-nine steps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. What do you think I ought to do about that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Well, I think you ought to&mdash;well, send flowers or something, to
sort of recognize that the thing had happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>somewhat awed</i>]. Is the king’s cousin sore?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Well, naturally he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I don’t mean sore that way. I mean did he&mdash;did he take it hard?
Did he think there was any ill feeling from the United States Government
in the sailor’s&mdash;action?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Why, I suppose you might say yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, you tell him that the sailor had no instructions to do any
such thing. Demand the sailor’s resignation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> And Major-General Pushing has been wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span>ing to see you for some
time. Shall I tell him to come out here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> All right.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jones goes into the White House and returns, announcing:
“Major-General Pushing, U. S. A.”</i></p>

<p><i>Out marches General Pushing. He is accompanied at three paces by a
fifer and drummer, who play a spirited march. When the General
reaches the President’s table the trio halt, the fife and drum
cease playing, and the General salutes.</i></p>

<p><i>The General is a small fat man with a fierce gray mustache. His
chest and back are fairly obliterated with medals, and he is
wearing one of those great shakos peculiar to drum-majors.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Good morning, General Pushing. Did they keep you waiting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>fiercely</i>]. That’s all right. We’ve been marking
time&mdash;it’s good for some of the muscles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> How’s the army?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing.</span> Very well, Mr. President. Several of the privates have
complained of headaches. [<i>He clears his throat portentously.</i>] I’ve
called on you to say I’m afraid we’ve got to have war. I held a
conference last night with two others of our best generals. We discussed
the matter thoroughly, and then we took a vote. Three to nothing in
favor of war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>alarmed</i>]. Look at here, General Pushing, I’ve got a lot of
things on my hands now, and the last thing I want to have is a war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing.</span> I knew things weren’t going very well with you, Mr.
President. In fact, I’ve always thought that what this country needs is
a military man at the head of it. The people are restless and excited.
The best thing to keep their minds occupied is a good war. It will leave
the country weak and shaken&mdash;but docile, Mr. President, docile.
Besides&mdash;we voted on it, and there you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Who is it against?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing.</span> That we have not decided. We’re going to take up the
details to-night. It depends on&mdash;just how much money there is in the
Treasury. Would you mind calling up your&mdash;<i>father</i>&mdash; [<i>the General gives
this word an ironic accentuation</i>]&mdash;and finding out?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry takes up the white telephone from the table. Jones meanwhile
has produced the shaker and glasses. He pours a cocktail for every
one&mdash;even for the fifer and drummer.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>at the ’phone</i>]. Connect me with the Treasury Department,
please.... Is this the Treasury?... This is President Frost.... Oh, I’m
very well, thanks. No, it’s better. Much better. The dentist says he
doesn’t think I’ll have to have it out now.... Say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> what I called you
up about is to find how much money there is in the Treasury.... Oh, I
see.... Oh, I see. Thanks. [<i>He hangs up the receiver.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>worried</i>]. General Pushing, things seem to be a little confused
over at the Treasury. Dada&mdash;the Secretary of the Treasury isn’t there
right now&mdash;and they say nobody else knows much about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>disapprovingly</i>]. Hm! I could put you on a nice war
pretty cheap. I could manage a battle or so for almost nothing. [<i>With
rising impatience.</i>] But a good President ought to be able to tell just
how much we could afford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>chastened</i>]. I’ll find out from Dada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>meaningly</i>]. Being President is a sacred trust, you
know, Mr. Frost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, I know it’s a sacred trust, don’t I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. Are you proud of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>utterly crestfallen</i>]. Of course, I’m proud of it. Don’t I look
proud? I’m proud as a pecan. [<i>Resentfully.</i>] What do you know about it,
anyways? You’re nothing but a common soldier&mdash;I mean a common general.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>pityingly</i>]. I came here to help you, Mr. Frost.
[<i>With warning emphasis.</i>] Perhaps you are aware that the sovereign
State of Idaho is about to ask your resignation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>now thoroughly resentful</i>]. Look at here, suppose you be the
President for a while, if you know so much about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>complacently</i>]. I’ve often thought that what this
country needs is a military man at the head of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> All right, then, you just take off that hat and coat!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jerry takes off his own coat. Jones rushes forward in alarm.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> If there’s going to be a fight hadn’t we all better go into the
billiard-room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>insistently to General Pushing</i>]. Take off that hat and coat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>aghast</i>]. But, Mr. President&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Listen here&mdash;if I’m the President you do what I say.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>General Pushing obediently removes his sword and takes off his hat
and coat. He assumes a crouching posture and, putting up his fists,
begins to dance menacingly around Jerry.</i></p>

<p><i>But, instead of squaring off, Jerry gets quickly into the
General’s hat and coat and buckles on the sword.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> All right, since you know so much about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> being President, you put
on my hat and coat and try it for a while.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The General, greatly taken aback, looks from Jerry to Jerry’s
coat, with startled eyes. Jerry swaggers up and down the lawn,
brandishing the sword. Then his eyes fall with distaste upon the
General’s shirtsleeves.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, what are you moping around for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>plaintively</i>]. Come on, Mr. President, be reasonable.
Give me that coat and hat. Nobody appreciates a good joke any more than
I do, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>emphatically</i>]. No, I <i>won’t</i> give them to you. I’m a general,
and I’m going to war. You can stay around here. [<i>Sarcastically, to Mr.
Jones.</i>] He’ll straighten everything out, Mr. Jones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>pleadingly</i>]. Mr. President, I’ve waited for this war
for forty years. You wouldn’t take away my coat and hat like that, just
as we’ve got it almost ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>pointing to the shirtsleeves</i>]. That’s a nice costume to be
hanging around the White House in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>brokenly</i>]. I can’t help it, can I? Who took my coat
and hat, anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> If you don’t like it you can get out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>sarcastically</i>]. Yes. Nice lot of talk it’d cause if I
went back to the War Department looking like this. “Where’s your hat and
coat, General?” “Oh, I just thought I’d come down in my suspenders this
morning.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> You can have my coat&mdash;and my troubles.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Charlotte comes suddenly out of the White House, and they turn
startled eyes upon her, like two guilty schoolboys.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>staring</i>]. What’s the matter? Has everything gone to pieces?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>on the verge of tears</i>]. He took my coat and hat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>pointing to the General</i>]. Who is that man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>in a dismal whine</i>]. I’m Major-General Pushing, I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I don’t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>uneasily</i>]. Yes, he is, Charlit. I was just kidding him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>understanding immediately</i>]. Oh, you’ve been <i>nag</i>ging
people again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>beginning to unbutton the coat</i>]. The General was nagging me,
Charlit. I’ve just been teaching him a lesson&mdash;haven’t I, General?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He struggles out of the General’s coat and into his own. The
General, grunting his relief and disgust, re-attires himself in the
military garment.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>losing confidence under Charlotte’s stare</i>]. Honest,
everything’s getting on my nerves. First it’s some correspondence school
getting funny, and then <i>he</i> [<i>indicating the General</i>] comes around,
and then all the people out in Idaho&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>with brows high</i>]. Well, if you want to know what <i>I</i> think,
<i>I</i> think everything’s going to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, it isn’t, Charlit. I’m going to fix everything. I’ve got a
firm grip on everything. Haven’t I, Mr. Jones? I’m just nervous, that’s
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>now completely buttoned up, physically and mentally</i>].
In my opinion, sir, you’re a very dangerous man. I have served under
eight Presidents, but I have never before lost my coat and hat. I bid
you good morning, Mr. President. You’ll hear from me later.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>At his salute the fife and drum commence to play. The trio execute
about face, and the escort, at three paces, follows the General out
the gate.</i></p>

<p><i>Jerry stares uneasily after them.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Everybody’s always saying that I’m going to hear from ’em later.
They want to kick me out of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span> job&mdash;that’s what they want. They think
I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> The people elected you, Mr. President. And the people want
you&mdash;all except the ones out in Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>anxiously</i>]. Couldn’t you be on the safe side and have
yourself reduced to Vice-President, or something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Newsboy</span> [<i>outside</i>]. Extra! Extra! Idaho says: “Resign or be
Impeached.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Was that newsboy yelling something about me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>witheringly</i>]. He never so much as mentioned you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>In response to Mr. Jones’s whistle a full-grown newsboy comes in
at the gate. He hands Jerry a paper and is given a bill.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>carelessly</i>]. Keep the change. It’s all right. I’ve got a big
salary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Newsboy</span> [<i>pointing to Jerry’s frock coat</i>]. I almost had one of them
dress suits once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>not without satisfaction</i>]. I got six of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Newsboy.</span> I hadda get one so I could take a high degree in the Ku
Klux. But I didn’t get one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>absorbed in the paper</i>]. I got six of ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Newsboy.</span> I ain’t got none. Well, much obliged. So long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>The newsboy goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span> [<i>reading over Jerry’s shoulder</i>]. It says: “Idaho flays Treasury
choice.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>wide-eyed</i>]. Does that mean they’re going to flay Dada?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span> [<i>looking at his watch</i>]. Senator Fish will be here at any moment
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Well, all I know is that I’d show some spunk and not let them
kick <i>me</i> out, even if I <i>was</i> the worst President they ever had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Listen, Charlit, you needn’t remind me of it every minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I didn’t remind you of it. I just mentioned it in an ordinary
tone of voice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She goes into the White House. Senator Joseph Fish comes in
hesitantly through the gate.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Jones</i>]. Here comes the State of Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>timorously</i>]. Good morning, Mr. President. How are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Oh, I’m all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>hurriedly producing the telegram and mumbling his words</i>]. Got a
little matter here, disagreeable duty. Want to get through as quickly as
possible. “Senator Joseph Fish, Washington, D. C. Present the State of
Idaho’s compliments to President Frost, and tell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span> that the people of
Idaho demand his immediate resignation.” [<i>He folds up the telegram and
puts it in his pocket.</i>] Well, Mr. President, I guess I got to be going.
[<i>He moves toward the gate and then hesitates.</i>] This was to have been
my wedding-reception day. Of course, Doris will never marry me now. It’s
a very depressing thing to me, President Frost. [<i>With his hand on the
gate latch.</i>] I suppose you want me to tell ’em you won’t resign, don’t
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> We won’t resign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Well, then it’s only right to tell you that Judge Fossile of the
Supreme Court will bring a motion of impeachment at three o’clock this
afternoon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He turns melancholy eyes on Doris’s window. He kisses his hand
toward it in a tragic gesture of farewell. Then he goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Jerry looks at Mr. Jones as though demanding encouragement.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> They don’t know the man they’re up against, do they, Mr. Jones?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> They certainly do not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>lying desperately and not even convincing himself</i>]. I’ve got
resources they don’t know about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> If you’ll pardon a suggestion, I think the best move you could
make, Mr. President, would be to demand your father’s resignation
immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>incredulously</i>]. Put Dada out? Why, he used to work in a bank
when he was young, and he knows all about the different amounts of
money.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>A pause.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>uncertainly</i>]. Do you think I’m the worst President they ever
had?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span> [<i>considering</i>]. Well, no, there was that one they impeached.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>consoling himself</i>]. And then there was that other fellow&mdash;I
forget his name. He was <i>ter</i>rible. [<i>Another disconsolate pause.</i>] I
suppose I might as well go down and get a cigar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> There’s just one more man out here to see you and he says he came
to do you a favor. His name is&mdash;the Honorable Snooks, or Snukes,
Ambassador from Irish Poland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What country’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Irish Poland’s one of the new European countries. They took a
sort of job lot of territories that nobody could use and made a country
out of them. It’s got three or four acres of Russia and a couple of
mines in Austria and a few lots in Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Show them all out here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> There’s only one. [<i>He goes into the White House, returning
immediately.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> The Honorable Snooks, or Snukes, Ambassador to the United States
from Irish Poland.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Honorable Snooks comes out through the swinging doors. His
resemblance to Mr. Snooks, the bootlegger, is, to say the least,
astounding. But his clothes&mdash;they are the clothes of the Corps
Diplomatique. Red stockings enclose his calves, fading at the knee
into black satin breeches. His coat, I regret to say, is faintly
reminiscent of the Order of Mystic Shriners, but a broad red ribbon
slanting diagonally across his diaphragm gives the upper part of
his body a svelte, cosmopolitan air. At his side is slung an
unusually long and cumbersome sword.</i></p>

<p><i>He comes in slowly, I might even say cynically, and after a brief
nod at Jerry, surveys his surroundings with an appraising eye.</i></p>

<p><i>Jones goes to the table and begins writing.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Got a nice house, ain’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>still depressed from recent reverses</i>]. Yeah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Wite, hey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>as if he had just noticed it</i>]. Yeah, white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Get dirty quick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>adopting an equally laconic manner</i>]. Have it washed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> How’s your old woman?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>uneasily</i>]. She’s all right. Have a cigar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>taking the proffered cigar</i>]. Thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> That’s all right. I got a lot of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> That’s some cigar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I got a lot of them. I don’t smoke that kind myself, but I got a
lot of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> That’s swell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>becoming boastful</i>]. See that tree? [<i>The white tree.</i>] Look,
that’s a special tree. You never saw a tree like that before. Nobody’s
got one but me. That tree was given to me by some natives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> That’s swell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> See this cane? The band around it’s solid gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Is that right? I thought maybe it was to keep the squirrels from
crawling up. [<i>Abruptly.</i>] Need any liquor? I get a lot, you know, on
account of bein’ an ambassador. Gin, vermuth, bitters, absinthe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, I don’t.... See that sign? I bet you never saw one like that
before. I had it invented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>bored</i>]. Class. [<i>Switching the subject.</i>] I hear you made your
old man Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> My father used to work in a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> You’d ought to made him official Sandy Claus.... How you gettin’
away with your job?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>lying</i>]. Oh, fine&mdash;fine! You ought to see the military review
they had for me last week. Thousands and thousands of soldiers, and
everybody cheered when they saw me. [<i>Heartily.</i>] It was sort of
inspiring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> I seen you plantin’ trees in the movies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. Sure. I do that almost every day. That’s nothing to
some of the things I have to do. But the thing is, I’m not a bit stuck
up about any of it. See that gate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Yeah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>now completely and childishly happy</i>]. I had it made that way so
that anybody passing by along the street can look in. Cheer them up,
see? Sometimes I come out here and sit around just so if anybody passes
by&mdash;well, there I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>sarcastically</i>]. You ought to have yourself covered with radium
so they can see you in the dark. [<i>He changes his tone now and comes
down to business.</i>] Say, you’re lucky I found you in this morning. Got
the time with you?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry pulls out his watch. Snooks takes it as though to inspect it

<p>Look here now, Mr. President. I got a swell scheme for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>trying to look keen</i>]. Let’s hear it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> You needn’t got to think now, just ’cause I’m a hunerd per cent
Irish Pole, that I ain’t goin’ to do the other guy a favor once in a
while. An’ I got somep’m smooth for you. [<i>He puts Jerry’s watch in his
own pocket&mdash;the nerve of the man!</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>confidentially</i>]. Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What islands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> The Buzzard Islands.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jerry looks blank.</i></p></div>

<p>Ain’t you neva hearda the Buzzard Islands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>apologetically</i>]. I never was any good at geography. I used to
be pretty good in penmanship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>in horror</i>]. You ain’t neva hearda the Buzzard Islands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> It’s sort of a disagreeable name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> The Buzzard Islands. Property of the country of Irish Poland.
Garden spots. Flowery paradises ina middle of the Atlantic. Rainbow
Islandsa milk an’ honey, palms an’ pines, smellin’ with good-smellin’
woods and high-priced spices. Fulla animals with million buck skins and
with birds that’s got feathers that the hat dives on Fifth Avenue would
go nuts about. The folks in ee islands&mdash;swell-lookin’, husky, square,
rich, one hunerd per cent Buzzardites.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>startled</i>]. You mean Buzzards?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> One hunerd per cent Buzzardites, crazy about their island,
butter, milk, live stock, wives, and industries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>fascinated</i>]. Sounds sort of pretty, don’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Pretty? Say, it’s smooth! Now here’s my proposition, an’ take it
from me, it’s the real stuff. [<i>Impressively.</i>] The country of Irish
Poland wants to sell you the Buzzard Islands&mdash;cheap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>impressed</i>]. You’re willing to sell ’em, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Listen. I’ll be fair with you. [<i>I regret to say that at this
point he leans close to Jerry, removes the latter’s stick pin and places
it in his own tie.</i>] I’ve handed you the swellest proposition ever laid
before a President since Andrew Jackson bought the population of Ireland
from Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Yeah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>intently</i>]. Take it from me, Pres, and snap it up&mdash;dead cheap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> You’re sure it’s a good&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. Say, do you think an ambassador would tell you
something that ain’t true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [“<i>man to man</i>”]. That’s right, Mr. Snooks. I beg your pardon for
that remark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>touching his handkerchief to his eyes</i>]. You hurt me, Pres, you
hurt me, but I forgive you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>They shake hands warmly.</i></p>

<p><i>And now Jerry has an idea&mdash;a gorgeous idea. Why didn’t he think of
it before? His voice literally trembles as he lays his plan before
Snooks.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Honorable Snooks, listen. I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll&mdash;I’ll
take those Islands and pay&mdash;oh, say a round million dollars for them, on
one condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>quickly</i>]. Done. Name your condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>breathlessly</i>]. That you’ll let me throw in one of the States on
the trade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> What State?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> The State of Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> How much do you want for it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. Oh, I’ll just throw that in free.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Snooks indicates Mr. Jones with his thumb.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Get him to take it down.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jones takes pen in hand. During the ensuing conversation he writes
busily.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>anxiously</i>]. The State of Idaho is just a gift, see? But you
<i>got</i> to take it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Suddenly the Honorable Snooks realizes how the land lies. He looks
narrowly at Jerry, marvelling at an opportunity so ready to his
hand.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Jones</i>]. Here, get this down. We agree to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span> buy the Buzzard
Islands from the nation of Irish Poland for one million&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>interrupting</i>]. Two million.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Two million dollars, on condition that Irish Poland will also
incorporate into their nation the State of Idaho, with all its people.
Be sure and get that, Jones. With all its people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> I have it. The State of Idaho and four hundred and thirty-one
thousand, eight hundred and sixty-six people. Including colored?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Yes, including colored.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>craftily</i>]. Just a minute, Pres. This here State of Idaho is
mostly mountains, ain’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>anxiously</i>]. I don’t know. Is it, Mr. Jones?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> It has quite a few mountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>hesitating</i>]. Well, now, I don’t know if we better do it after
all&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>quickly</i>]. Three millions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> I’ll tell you, I’d like to pull it off for you, Pres, but you
see a State like that has gotta have upkeep. You take one of them
mountains, for instance. You can’t just let a mountain alone like you
would a&mdash;a ocean. You got to&mdash;to groom it. You got to&mdash;to chop it down.
You got to explore it. Now take that alone&mdash;you got to explore it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>swallowing</i>]. Four millions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> That’s more like it. Now these Buzzard Islands don’t require no
attention. You just have to let ’em alone. But you take the up-keep on a
thing like the State of Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>wiping his brow</i>]. Five millions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Sold! You get the Buzzard Islands and we get five million bucks
and the State of Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Got that down, Jones?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> On second thoughts&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>in a panic</i>]. No, no, you can’t get out of it. It’s all down in
black and white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>resignedly</i>]. Awright. I must say, Mr. President, you turned
out to be a real man. When I first met you I wouldn’t have thought it,
but I been pleasantly surprised.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He slaps Jerry heartily on the back. Jerry is so tickled at the
solution of the Idaho problem that he feverishly seizes Snooks’s
hand.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> And even if Irish Poland gets stung on the deal, we’ll put it
through. Say, you and me ain’t politicians, fella, we’re statesmen, real
statesmen. You ain’t got a cigarette about you, have you?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry hands him his cigarette case. Snooks, after taking one,
returns the case to his own pocket.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>enthusiastically</i>]. Send me a post-card, Ambassador Snooks. The
White House, City, will reach me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Post-card! Say, lay off. You and me are pals. I’d do anything
for a pal. Come on down to the corner and I’ll buy you a cigar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Mr. Jones</i>]. I guess I can go out now for a while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Hang on to that treaty. And, say, when the Secretary of the
Treasury wakes up tell him I’ve got to have five million dollars right
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> If you’ll just come into the office for a moment you can put your
signatures on it right away.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry and the Honorable Snooks go into the White House arm in arm,
followed by Mr. Jones. Presently Jerry can be seen in the window of
the President’s office.</i></p>

<p><i>A moment later the doors swing open again, this time for the
tottering egress of Dada.</i></p>

<p><i>Dada, not without difficulty, arranges himself a place in the sun.
He is preparing for his morning siesta, and, indeed, has almost
managed to spread a handkerchief over his face when in through the
gate comes Doris. Her eye falls on him and a stern purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span> is
born. Dada, seeing her approach, groans in anticipation.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Dada, I want to speak to you.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Dada blinks up at her, wearily.</i></p></div>

<p>Dada, I want to tell you something for your own good and for Jerry’s
good. You want Jerry to keep his position, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Jerry’s a fine boy. He was born to my second wife in eighteen
hundred and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>interrupting impatiently</i>]. Yes, I know he was. But I mean now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> No, I’ll never have any more children. Children are hard to raise
properly.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>This is aimed at her.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Look at here, Dada. What I think is the best thing to do is to
resign your position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> The&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> You’re too old, you see, if you know what I mean. You’re sort
of&mdash;oh, not crazy, but just sort of feeble-minded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>who has caught one word</i>]. Yes, I’m a little feeble. [<i>He dozes
off.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>absorbed in her thesis</i>]. I don’t mean you’re crazy. Don’t get
mad. I don’t mean you go around<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> thinking you’re like Napoleon or a
poached egg or anything like that, but you’re sort of feeble-minded.
Don’t you understand, yourself? Sort of simple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>waking up suddenly</i>]. How’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>infuriated</i>]. That’s <i>just</i> the sort of thing I was talking
about! Going to sleep like that when a person’s trying to tell you
something for your own son’s good. That’s just <i>exactly</i> what I mean!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>puzzled but resentful</i>]. I don’t like you. You’re a very forward
young girl. Your parents brought you up very unsuccessfully indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>smugly</i>]. All right. You’re just making me think so more than
ever. Go right ahead. Don’t mind me. Go right ahead. Then when you begin
to really <i>rave</i> I’ll send for the lunatic-asylum wagon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>with an air of cold formality</i>]. I’ll ask you to excuse me. [<i>He
wants to get to sleep.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> First thing you know you’ll take all the money in the Treasury
and hide it and forget where you put it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>succinctly</i>]. There isn’t any money in the Treasury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>after a stunned pause</i>]. Just what do you mean by that
statement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>drowsily</i>]. There isn’t any money in the Treasury. There was
seven thousand dollars left yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> but I worked from morning till
night and now there isn’t one red penny in there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> You must be crazy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> [<i>He can scarcely keep awake.</i>] Hm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Look at here! What do you mean&mdash;have you been spending that
money&mdash;that doesn’t belong to you, you know&mdash;on some fast woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>as usual, he doesn’t quite hear</i>]. Yes, it’s all gone. I went
down yesterday morning and I said to myself: “Horatio, you got only
seven thousand dollars left, and you got to work from morning till night
and get rid of it.” And I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>furious, but impressed at the magnitude of the crime</i>]. How much
was there altogether?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Altogether? I haven’t the figures with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Why, you old dumb-bell, you. Imagine an old man your age that
hasn’t had anything to do for twenty years but just sit around and
<i>think</i>, going crazy about a woman at your age! [<i>With scornful pity.</i>]
Don’t you know she just made a fool of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>shaking his finger at her</i>]. You must not talk like that. Be
courteous and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Yes, and pretty soon some woman comes along and you get
“courteous” with her to the extent of all the money in the Treasury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Yes, that’s one thing that stood me in good stead. My mother used
to say to me: “Horatio&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>paying no attention to him</i>]. What was her name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Her name was Roxanna.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Where did she get hold of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> My mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Your paramour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> She used to say to me: “Horatio&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> She probably used to say a lot more than that! Oh, I know how
they handle old men like you. I’ve seen a lot of that. Slush is what
appeals to old men like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> No&mdash;I said courtesy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> You mean slush. What did she call you?&mdash;her old toodledums? And
all that sort of thing? How perfectly disgusting!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Out comes Jerry now, just in time to catch Dada’s next remark, and
to realize that there’s persecution in the air.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>to Doris</i>]. It’s been a hot day and I’ll ask you to excuse me. I
never liked you, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Say, Doris, why can’t you leave Dada alone? He’s got more
important things to think about than your new dresses and your silk
stockings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Got something more important than silk stockings, has he? Ask
him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Dada’s got a lot more to him than anybody ever gives him credit
for, haven’t you, Dada?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. Yeah, yeah. All right. Wait till you hear what he’s
done now. Wait till you hear. [<i>To Dada.</i>] Tell him what you did at your
age. Some woman came up to him and said “Horatio&mdash;” [<i>She gives an
awe-inspiring imitation of a passionate woman.</i>] and he said: “Here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>interrupting</i>]. What woman did?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Her name was Roxanna. Ask him where all the money in the Treasury
is. At his age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>in growing alarm</i>]. Look at here, Doris&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> The&mdash;old&mdash;dumb-bell! I take back what I said about your not being
really crazy. [<i>To Jerry.</i>] Look out, he’ll begin to rave. [<i>She
pretends to be alarmed.</i>] Yes, Dada, you’re a poached egg. It’s all
right. I’ll send for the lunatic-asylum wagon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> I’ve been working in the dark. I thought it best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> You needn’t tell us all the disgusting details. Please respect my
engagement. You must have bought her about everything in the world. No
wonder I can’t get any good shoes in Washington. Jerry should have got
you analyzed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jerry now begins to realize that something appalling has indeed
happened. He sits down weakly.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> I was working in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, Jerry should of had you analyzed in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>suddenly</i>]. Char-lit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>at the upper window</i>]. Stop screaming at me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Charlit, come on out here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Dada’s done something awful. At his age!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Hurry up out, Charlit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> You wouldn’t want me to come out in my chemise, would you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It wouldn’t matter. We’ll be kicked out, anyways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Has Dada been drinking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Worse than that. Some woman’s got ahold of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Don’t let him go till I come down. I can handle him.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Mr. Jones comes out.</i></p></div>

o’clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>wildly</i>]. We’ve got a maniac here. Go get some rope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Jones</span> [<i>in horror</i>]. Are you going to hang him?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Out rushes Charlotte.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> The United States was the wealthiest country in all the world.
It’s easier for a camel to pass through a needle’s eye than for a
wealthy man to enter heaven.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>They all listen in expectant horror.</i></p></div>

<p>So all the money in the Treasury I have had destroyed by fire, or dumped
into the deep sea. We are all saved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Do you mean to say that you haven’t even got five million
dollars?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> I finished it all up yesterday. It was not easy. It took a lot of
resourcefulness, but I did it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>in horror</i>]. But I’ve got to have five million dollars this
afternoon or I can’t get rid of Idaho, and I’ll be impeached!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>complacently</i>]. We’re all saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> It’s all over, Mr. President. I’ve just received word that Chief
Justice Fossile of the Supreme Court, accompanied by the Senate
Committee on Inefficiency, is on his way to the White House.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jerry sits down, completely overcome. Jones retires.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> They goin’ to throw you out on your ear, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>brooding</i>]. It’s that low, mean bunch of people out in Idaho.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Snooks, who has been ruminating on the situation, comes to a
decision.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Look at here, Mr. President, I’m goin’ to help you out. I’ll
pass up that five million bucks and we’ll make a straight swap of the
Buzzard Islands for the State of Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>in amazement</i>]. You’ll give me the Buzzard Islands for the State
of Idaho?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Snooks nods. Jerry wrings his hand in great emotion.</i></p>

<p><i>At this point Charlotte comes out of the White House. At the sight
of the Honorable Snooks a somewhat disapproving expression passes
over her face.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. Charlit&mdash;Charlit. This gentleman has saved me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>suspiciously</i>]. Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> His name is The Honorable Snooks, Charlit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>under Charlotte’s stern eye</i>]. Well, I guess I got to be goin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Won’t you stay for my husband’s impeachment? We’re having a
few people in.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Out comes Doris, accompanied by Dada. Dada is in such a state of
exultation that much to Doris’s annoyance he is attempting a
gavotte with her.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>repulsing him</i>]. Say, haven’t I got enough troubles having to
throw over my fiancé, without having you try to do your indecent old
dances with me?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Dada sits down and regards the heavens with a long telescope.</i></p>

<p><i>Jerry has now recovered his confidence and is marching up and down
waving his arms and rehearsing speeches under his breath. Snooks
taps Dada’s head and winks lewdly at Charlotte and Doris.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Honestly, everybody seems to be going a little crazy around here.
Is Jerry going to be fired or isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> He says he isn’t, but I don’t believe him for a minute.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jones comes out, followed by an excitable Italian gentleman with
long, musical hair.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones.</span> This gentleman said he had an appointment with Miss Doris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Gentleman.</span> I am Stutz-Mozart’s Orang-Outang Band. I am ordered to
come here with my band at three o’clock to play high-class jazz at young
lady’s wedding reception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I remember now. I <i>did</i> order him. It’s supposed to be the best
jazz band in the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Stutz-Mozart</i>]. Don’t you know there’s going to be a big
political crisis here at three o’clock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> We can’t use you now, Mr. Stutz-Mozart. Anyways, I had to throw
over my fiancé on account of political reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stutz-Mozart</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. But I have my orang-outang band outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>her eyes staring</i>]. Real orang-outangs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Of course not. They just call it that because they look kind of
like orang-outangs. And they play kind of like orang-outangs, sort of. I
mean the way orang-outangs would play if they knew how to play at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>to Stutz-Mozart</i>]. Well, you’ll have to get them away from here.
I can’t have a lot of senators and judges coming in and finding me with
a bunch of men that look like orang-outangs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stutz-Mozart.</span> But I have been hired to play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Yes, but what do you think people would say? They’d say: Yes,
here’s a fine sort of President we’ve got. All his friends look sort of
like orang-outangs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stutz-Mozart.</span> You waste my time. You pay me or else we play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Look at here. If you’re one of these radical agitators my advice
to you is to go right back where you came from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stutz-Mozart.</span> I came from Hoboken.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>He goes threateningly out the gate.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones</span> [<i>announcing from the steps</i>]. Chief Justice Fossile of the

just a vegetable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Here they come! Chief Justice Fossile, in a portentous white wig,

<p><i>The delegation comes to a halt before Jerry, who regards it

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> To the President of the United States&mdash;greetings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Mr. President, on the motion of the gentleman from
Idaho&mdash; [<i>He points to Fish, who tries unsuccessfully to shrink out of
sight.</i>] we have come to analyze you, with a view to impeachment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>sarcastically</i>]. Oh, is that so? [<i>He looks for encouragement at
Charlotte. Charlotte grunts.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> I believe that is the case, Senator Fish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Yes, but personally I like him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, you do, do you? [<i>She nudges Jerry.</i>] Speak right up to
them like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Oh, you do, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Remove that woman!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>No one pays any attention to his request.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Now, Mr. President, do you absolutely refuse to resign on
the request of the Senator from Idaho?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> You’re darn right I refuse!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Well, then, I&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>At this point Mr. Stutz-Mozart’s Orang-Outang Band outside of the

silk hats, get to their feet, one by one. Even Judge Fossile stands
at respectful attention until the number dies away.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Ha-ha! That wasn’t “The Star-Spangled Banner.”</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>The Senators look confused.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>tragically</i>]. This was to have been my wedding reception day.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Senator Fish begins to weep softly to himself.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile</span> [<i>angrily to Jerry</i>]. This is preposterous, sir! You’re a
dangerous man! You’re a menace to the nation! We will proceed no
further. Have you anything to say before we vote on the motion made by
the State of Idaho?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Yes, he has. He’s got a whole mouthful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> This is the feature moment of my life. Cecil B. Demille would
shoot it with ten cameras.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Remove these women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>The women are not removed.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Gentlemen, before you take this step into your
hands I want to put my best foot forward. Let us consider a few aspects.
For instance, for the first aspect let us take, for example, the War of
the Revolution. There was ancient Rome, for example. Let us not only
live so that our children who live after us, but also that our ancestors
who preceded us and fought to make this country what it is!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>General applause.</i></p></div>

<p>And now, gentlemen, a boy to-day is a man to-morrow&mdash;or, rather, in a
few years. Consider the winning of the West&mdash;Daniel Boone and Kit
Carson, and in our own time Buffalo Bill and&mdash;and Jesse James!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Prolonged applause.</i></p></div>

<p>Finally, in closing, I want to tell you about a vision of mine that I
seem to see. I seem to see
Columbia&mdash;Columbia&mdash;ah&mdash;blindfolded&mdash;ah&mdash;covered with scales&mdash;driving
the ship of state over the battle-fields of the republic into the heart
of the golden West and the cotton-fields of the sunny South.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Great applause. Mr. Jones, with his customary thoughtfulness,
serves a round of cocktails.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. Gentlemen, you must not let yourselves be
moved by this man’s impassioned rhetoric.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> The State of Idaho has moved
his impeachment. We shall put it to a vote&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>interrupting</i>]. Listen here, Judge Fossile, a state has got to
be part of a country in order to impeach anybody, don’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, the State of Idaho doesn’t belong to the United States any
more.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>A general sensation. Senator Fish stands up and sits down.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Then who does it belong to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>pushing his way to the front</i>]. It belongs to the nation of
Irish Poland.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>An even greater sensation.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> The State of Idaho is nothing but a bunch of mountains. I’ve
traded it to the nation of Irish Poland for the Buzzard Islands.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Mr. Jones hands the treaty to Judge Fossile.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>on his feet</i>]. Judge Fossile, the people of Idaho&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Treason! Treason! Set down, fella! You’re a subject of the
nation of Irish Poland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>pointing to Fish</i>]. Those foreigners think they can run this
country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>The other Senators shrink away from Fish.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile</span> [<i>to Fish</i>]. If you want to speak as a citizen of the
United States, you’ll have to take out naturalization papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> I won’t let him. I’m goin’ to take him with me. He’s part of our

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Just at this point, when Jerry seems to have triumphed all around,

<p><span class="smcap">The Senators.</span> Hurrah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Who is the enemy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing.</span> The enemy is the nation of Irish Poland!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>All eyes are now turned upon Snooks, who looks considerably

<p><span class="smcap">The Senators.</span> Hurrah! Hurrah! Down with Irish Poland!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Now, Mr. President, all treaties are off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>looking scornfully at Jerry</i>]. He tried to trade the
State of Idaho for some islands full of Buzzards. Bah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Senators.</span> Bah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. What’s ee idea? Is this a frame-up to beat the
nation of Irish Poland outa their rights? We want the State of Idaho.
You want the Buzzard Islands, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing.</span> We can take them by force. We’re at war. [<i>To the
Senators.</i>] We’ve ordered all stuffed Buzzards to be removed from the
natural history museums. [<i>Cheers.</i>] And domestic Buzzards are now fair
game, both in and out of season. [<i>More cheers.</i>] Buzzard domination
would be unthinkable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile</span> [<i>pointing to Jerry</i>]. And now, Senators. How many of you
vote for the impeachment of this enemy of the commonwealth?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>The five Senators stand up.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile</span> [<i>to Jerry</i>]. The verdict of a just nation. Is there any

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Too late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Too late for the world to end this afternoon. I must have missed

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>shaking his finger back at her</i>]. Your parents brought you up

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile.</span> Silence! I will pronounce sentence of impeachment on this
enemy of mankind. Look upon him!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>They all look dourly at Jerry.</i></p></div>

<p>Now, gentlemen, the astronomers tell us that in the far<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span> heavens, near
the southern cross, there is a vast space called the hole in the sky,
where the most powerful telescope can discover no comet nor planet nor
star nor sun.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They all look very cold and depressed. Jerry shivers. Fish picks
up Dada’s abandoned telescope and begins an eager examination of
the firmament.</i></p></div>

<p>In that dreary, cold, dark region of space the Great Author of Celestial
Mechanism has left the chaos which was in the beginning. If the earth
beneath my feet were capable of expressing its emotions it would, with
the energy of nature’s elemental forces, heave, throw, and project this
enemy of mankind into that vast region, there forever to exist in a
solitude as eternal as&mdash;as eternity.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>When he finishes a funereal silence falls.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>his voice shaken with grief</i>]. Well, Judge, all I’ve got to say
is that no matter what you’d done I wouldn’t want to do all those things
to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Fossile</span> [<i>thunderously</i>]. Have you anything more to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>rising through his defeat to a sort of eloquent defiance</i>]. Yes.
I want to tell you all something. I don’t want to be President. [<i>A
murmur of surprise.</i>] I never asked to be President. Why&mdash;why, I don’t
even know how in hell I ever <i>got</i> to be President!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Pushing</span> [<i>in horror</i>]. Do you mean to say that there’s one
American citizen who does not desire the sacred duty of being President?
Sir, may I ask, then, just what you do want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>wildly</i>]. Yes! I want to be left alone.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Outside the wall Mr. Stutz-Mozart’s Orang-Outang Band strikes up

certain memorable night have been removed, but there is an air
about the house quite inconsistent with the happy day outside, an
air of catastrophe, a profound gloom that seems to have settled
even upon the “Library of Wit and Humor” in the dingy bookcase.</i></p>

<p><i>There is brooding going on upon the premises.</i></p>

<p><i>A quick tat-tat-tat from outdoors&mdash;the clatter of someone running

gum.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Voice.</span> [<i>It’s Charlotte’s. You’d scarcely have recognized it.</i>] I’ll

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Heard anything from Jerry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Not a word.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Doris regards herself silently, but with interest, in a small

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>with cheerful pessimism</i>]. Haven’t heard a word, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>lugubriously</i>]. No. Not one.</p>

away a week ago to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> It was that awful liquor, I <i>know</i>. He sat up all night and
in the morning he was gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It’s the funniest thing I ever heard of, his sneaking off this
way.... Say, Charlotte, I’ve been meaning to say something to you for a
couple of days, but I didn’t want to get you depressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> How could I possibly be any more depressed than I am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, I just wanted to ask you if you’d tried the morgue yet.

yourself. I simply think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span> ought to <i>try</i> it. If he’s anywhere you

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>wildly</i>]. Oh, he’s not dead! He’s not dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I didn’t say he was, did I? I didn’t say he was. But when a fella
wanders out tight after drinking some of this stuff, you can’t tell
<i>where</i> you’ll find him. Let me tell you, Charlotte, I’ve had more
experience with this sort of thing than you have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> The detective is coming to report this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Has he been combing the dives? You ought to have him comb the
dives, Charlotte. I saw a picture last week that ought to be a lesson to
any woman that loses her husband in a funny way like this. The woman in
this picture lost her husband and she just combed the dives and&mdash;there
he was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>suspiciously</i>]. What was he doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Some vampire was sitting on his lap in a café. [<i>Charlotte
moans.</i>] But it does show that if you do have the dives combed, you can
find ’em. That’s what this woman did.... There’s where most men go when
they wander out like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, no, Jerry wouldn’t go to the dives, or the&mdash;the morgue,
either. He’s never drank or done<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span> anything like that till that night.
He’s always been so mild and patient.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>This is a new note from Charlotte.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>after a thoughtful pause</i>]. Maybe he’s gone to Hollywood to go
in the movies. They say a lot of lost men turn up there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>brokenly</i>]. I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’m
re-responsible. He said that night he might have been P-President if it
hadn’t been for me. He’d just been analyzed, and they found he was
per-perfect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, with no reflections on the dead or anything like that,
Charlotte, he wasn’t so wonderful as you make out. You can take it from
me, he never would have been anything more than a postman if you hadn’t
made him be a railroad clerk.... I’d have the dives combed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>eulogistically</i>]. He was a good husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> You’ll get over it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Cheer up. In a year or so you’ll never know you ever had a
husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>bursting into tears at this</i>]. But I want him back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>reminiscently</i>]. Do you know the song? Do you know the song?
[<i>She sings</i>:]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She has forgotten her ethical connection and begins to enjoy the

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>in torture</i>]. Oh, don’t! Don’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Oh, excuse me. I didn’t think you’d take it personally.... It’s
just about colored people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, do you suppose he’s with some colored women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. No-o-o! What you need is to get your mind off it
for a while. Just say to yourself if he’s in a dive, he’s in a dive, and
if he’s in Hollywood, he’s in Hollywood, and if he’s in the morgue&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>frantically</i>]. If you say that word again, I’ll go crazy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span>&mdash;well, in that <i>place</i>, then, just say: “I can’t do anything
about it, so I’m going to forget it.” That’s what you want to say to
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> It’s easy enough to <i>say</i>, but I can’t get my mind&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Yes, you can. [<i>Magnanimously.</i>] I’ll tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span> you about what I’ve
been doing. I’ve had sort of a scrap with Joseph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Joseph who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Joseph Fish. He’s that fella I brought around here, only you
didn’t meet him. I told you about him. The one I got engaged to about
ten days ago. His patents were in the mortuary business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, I been trying to make him stop chewing gum. I offered to
give it up if he would. I think it’s sort of common when two people that
go together are always whacking away at a piece of gum, don’t you?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>There’s a ring at the door-bell.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> That’s the detective.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>prudently</i>]. Have you got that liquor hidden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I threw that horrible stuff away. Go let him in.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Charlotte goes to the door and ushers in the detective. The
detective wears an expression of profound sagacity upon his
countenance.</i></p></div>

<p>Have you found him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective</span> [<i>impressively</i>]. Mrs. Frost, I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Alive?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Where is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Wait. Be calm. I’ve had several clews, and I’ve been
following them up one at a time. And I’ve located a man, who answers to
the first name of Jerry, that I think is your husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Where did you find him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> He was picked up trying to jimmy his way into a house on
Crest Avenue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Good heavens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Yep&mdash;and his name is Jerry. He had it tattooed on his
arm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Good God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> But there’s one thing that’s different from your
description. What color is your husband’s hair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Brown? Are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Am I sure? Of course I’m sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective</span> [<i>to Doris</i>]. Do you collaborate that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> When he left here it was brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Well, this fella’s hair was red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, it’s not Jerry then&mdash;it’s not Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>to Charlotte</i>]. Well, now, how do you know?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span> Maybe&mdash; [<i>She turns
to the detective.</i>] You see, this fella had been drinking some of this
funny liquor you get around here sometimes and it may just have turned
his hair red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>to the detective</i>]. Oh, do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> I never heard of a case like that. I knew a fella whose
hair was turned white by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I knew one, too. What was the name of the fella you knew?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Did this man claim to be my husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> No, madam, he didn’t. He said he had two wives out in
Montana, but none that he knew of in these parts. But of course he may
have been bluffing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It doesn’t sound like Jerry to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> But you can identify him by that tattoo mark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. Oh, he never had one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective</span> [<i>his face falling</i>]. Well, then, he’s not our man,
because this fella’s tattoo marks are three years old. Well, that’s a
disappointment. That’s a great disappointment for me. I’ve wasted some
time over this man. I’d been hoping he’d&mdash;ah&mdash;do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. Oh, no, he wouldn’t do at all. I’ll have to have
the right man or I won’t pay you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Well, now then, I’ve been following up another clew. Did
your husband ever have aphasia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, no, he’s always been very healthy. He had some skin
trouble about&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He doesn’t mean that, Charlotte. Aphasia’s where a man runs off
and commits murder and falls in love with a young girl under another
name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, no, he’s never done anything like this ever before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Suppose you tell me exactly what did happen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Well, I told you he’d been drinking something that had
spirits of nitrogen in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Spirits of nitrogen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> That’s what the man said. It was sympathetic gin that this
man had persuaded Jerry into buying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> And he’d been talking all evening about all the things he
could have done if I hadn’t stood in his way. He had some examination
he’d just taken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>explaining</i>]. A psychical examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective</span> [<i>wisely</i>]. I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> And my sister came over with the man she’s going to marry,
and she came up to see me, and when she came down Jerry was asleep in
his chair. Well, I didn’t go down. I wish I had now. And my sister here
and her fellow went away. Then I went to bed, and it seems to me I could
hear Jerry talking to himself in his sleep all night. I woke up about
twelve, and he was saying something loud, and I told him to shut the
door, because I could smell that awful sympathetic gin way up-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> And that’s all. When I came down next morning at seven, he
was gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective</span> [<i>rising</i>]. Well, Mrs. Frost, if your man can be located,
I’m going to locate him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Have you thought of combing the dives?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Have you combed the dives? It seems to me that I’d make the
rounds of all the dives, and I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if you’d see
this man with somebody sitting on his knee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective</span> [<i>to Charlotte</i>]. Does he run to that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>hurriedly</i>]. Oh, no. Oh, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>to Charlotte</i>]. How do you know?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A brisk knock at the door. Doris opens it eagerly, admitting a
small, fat, gray-haired man in a state of great indignation.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective</span> [<i>to Charlotte</i>]. Is this the pursued?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. You are speaking to Mr. Pushing. I employ or did
employ the man who lives in this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>wildly</i>]. Oh, where is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Pushing.</span> That’s what I came here to find out. He hasn’t been at work
for a week. I’m going to let him go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> You ought to be ashamed of yourself. He may be dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Pushing.</span> Dead or alive, he’s fired. I had him analyzed. He didn’t
have any ambition, and my analyzer gave him nothing but a row of
goose-eggs. Bah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I don’t care. He’s mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>correcting her</i>]. “Was” mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Detective.</span> Maybe you could tell me something about his habits in
business hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Pushing.</span> If you’ll come along with me I’ll show you his analyzed
record. We’re having it framed. [<i>Contemptuously.</i>] Good morning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes out. The Detective, after a nod at Charlotte and Doris,
follows him.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, I should think you’d be encouraged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, that detective found a fella that’s something like him. The
same first name, anyway. That shows they’re getting warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Somehow it doesn’t encourage me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Uncertain steps on the stairs. Dada appears wearing a battered hat
and carrying a book under his arm.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Hello, Dada. Where you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>hearing vague words</i>]. Hm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> He’s going down to the library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>in spirited disagreement</i>]. No. You were wrong that time. I’m not
going to the park. I’m going to the library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. Where do you think your son is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> The&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>louder</i>]. Where do you think Jerry is, by this time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>to Charlotte</i>]. Didn’t you tell me he was away?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Charlotte nods drearily.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>placidly</i>]. Hasn’t come back yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> No. We’re having the dives combed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Well, don’t worry. I remember I ran away<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span> from home once. It was
in 1846. I wanted to go to Philadelphia and see the Zoo. I tried to get
home, but they took me and locked me up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>to Charlotte</i>]. In the monkey house, I bet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> [<i>He missed this, thank God!</i>] Yes, that’s the only time I ever
ran away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> But this is a more serious thing, Dada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Boys will be boys.... Well, it looks like a nice day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>to Doris</i>]. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t even understand what
it’s all about. When the detective searched his bedroom he thought it
was the plumber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He understands. Sure you do, don’t you, Dada? You understand what
it’s all about, don’t you, Dada?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>aggravatingly</i>]. The&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh, let him go. He makes me nervous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Maybe he could think out some place where Jerry’s gone. He’s
supposed to <i>think</i> so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Well, good afternoon. I think I’ll go down to the library. [<i>Dada
goes out by the front door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Listen, Charlotte. I was going to tell you about Joseph&mdash;to get
your mind off yourself, don’t you remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I’ve gotten sort of tired of him. Honestly, I ought to get myself
psychoanalyzed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Why don’t you throw him over then? You ought to know how by
this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Of course, having been unlucky in your own marriageable
experience, you aren’t in a position to judge what I should do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Do you love him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, not&mdash;not especially.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Then throw him over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I would&mdash;except for one thing. You see, it’d be sort of hard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> No, it wouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Yes, it would. It wouldn’t be any cinch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, you see I’ve been married to him for three days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>astounded</i>]. What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> That isn’t very long, but you see in marriage every day counts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Well, then, you can’t throw him over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It’s next to impossible, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Was it a secret marriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Yes, there was nobody there but I and Joseph and the fella that
did it. And I’m still living at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span> home. You see, this girl that Joe was
keeping waiting to see whether he was going to marry me or not, got
impatient, and said she couldn’t be kept waiting any longer. It made her
sort of nervous. She couldn’t eat her meals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> So you got married. And now you’re tired of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> No, not exactly that, but it just sort of makes me uncomfortable,
Charlotte, to know that you can’t throw over the man you’ve got without
causing a lot of talk. Suppose he took to drink or something. You know
everybody can’t get rid of their husbands as easy as you did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> One husband was always enough for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> One may be all right for you, Charlotte, because you’re a
monographist, but supposing Rudolph Valentino, or the Prince of Wales,
or John D. Rockefeller was to walk in here and say: “Doris, I’ve
worshipped you from a distance on account of the picture that you sent
to the fame and fortune contest of the movie magazine, that got left out
by accident or lost or something. Will you marry me?” What would you
say, Charlotte?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I’d say no. I’d say, give me back Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Would you let having a husband stand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span> the way of your life’s
happiness? I tell you I wouldn’t. I’d say to Joe: “You run up to the
store and buy a bag of peanuts and come back in about twenty years.” I
would, Charlotte. If I could marry Douglas Fairbanks I’d get rid of
Joseph in some peaceful way if I <i>could</i>&mdash;but if I couldn’t I’d give him
some glass cough-drops without a minute’s hesitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>horrified</i>]. Doris!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> And I told Joseph so, too. This marriage business is all right
for narrow-minded people, but I like to be where I can throw over a
fella when it gets to be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> If you had Jerry you wouldn’t feel that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Why, can’t you see, Charlotte, that’s the way Jerry must have
felt?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Charlotte, overcome, rises to go.</i></p></div>

<p>And, Charlotte, I don’t want to depress you, but if he <i>is</i>&mdash;if it turns
out that he is in the mor&mdash;in that place&mdash;I know where you can get some
simply <i>stunning</i> mourning for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Charlotte begins to weep.</i></p></div>

<p>Why, what’s the matter? I just thought it’d cheer you up to know you
could get it cheap. You’ll have to watch your money, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Charlotte hurries from the room.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I wonder what’s the matter with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Fish</span> [<i>outside</i>]. Oh, Doris!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Doris goes to the window.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> How did you know I was here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>outside</i>]. They told me at your house. Can I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Yes, but don’t holler around so. Haven’t you got any respect for
the missing?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Fish comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Doris, I’m awfully sorry about&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Oh, Joseph, haven’t you got any sense? Sitting there last night
everything was perfect, and just when I was feeling sentimental you
began talking about embalming&mdash;in the <i>twi</i>light. And I was just about
to take out my removable bridge....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> I’m sorry.... Have they found your sister’s husband yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Has he gone away permanently? Or for good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> We don’t know. We’re having the dives combed. Listen, has any one
in your family ever had aphasia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> What’s that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Where you go off and fall in love with girls and don’t know what
you’re doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> I think my uncle had that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Sort of dazed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Well, sort of. When there was any women around he got sort of
dazed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>thoughtfully</i>]. I wonder if you could inherit a thing from your
uncle. [<i>She removes her gum secretly.</i>] What are you chewing, Joe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Oh, just an old piece of something I found in my mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It’s gum. I thought I asked you not to chew gum. It doesn’t look
clean-cut for a man to be chewing gum. You haven’t got any sense of
what’s nice, Joseph. See here, suppose I was at a reception and went up
to Mrs. Astor or Mrs. Vanderbilt or somebody, like this: [<i>She replaces
her own gum in her mouth&mdash;she needs it for her imitation.</i>] How do you
do, Mrs. Vanderbilt? [<i>Chew, chew.</i>] What do you think she’d say? Do you
think she’d stand it? Not for a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Well, when I start going with Mrs. Vanderbilt will be plenty of
time to stop.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>From outside is heard the sound of a metallic whistle, a melodious
call in C major.</i></p></div>

<p>What’s that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Don’t ask me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> It’s pretty. It must be some kind of bird.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>The whistle is repeated. It is nearer.</i></p></div>

<p>There it is again.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Doris goes to the window.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It’s only the postman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> I never heard a postman with a whistle like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> He must be a new one on this beat. That’s too bad. The old one
used to give me my mail wherever I met him, even if he was four or five

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>taken somewhat aback</i>]. Why, sure. I guess so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> It’s a nice morning out. You two ought to be out walking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>blankly</i>]. Huh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Is this number 2127? If it is, I’ve got a good-looking lot of
mail for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>with growing interest</i>]. What do you mean, a good looking lot of
mail?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> What do I <i>mean</i>? Why, I mean it’s got variety, of course.
[<i>Rummaging in his bag.</i>] I got eight letters for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Say, you’re new on this beat, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Yes, I’m new but I’m good. [<i>He produces a handful of letters.</i>]
I’m the best one they ever had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> How do you know? Did they tell you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, I just feel it. I know my job. I can give any other mailman
stamps and post-cards and beat him with bundles. I’m just naturally
<i>good</i>. I don’t know why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I never heard of a mailman being <i>good</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> They’re mostly all good. Some professions anybody can get into
them, like business or politics for instance, but you take
postmen&mdash;they’re like angels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span> they sort of pick ’em out.
[<i>Witheringly.</i>] They not only pick ’em out&mdash;they select ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>fascinated</i>]. And you’re the best one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>modestly</i>]. Yes, I’m the best one they ever had. [<i>He looks over
the letters.</i>] Now here’s what I call a clever ad. Delivered a lot of
these this morning. Children like ’em, you know. They’re from the carpet
company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Let’s see it. [<i>He takes the ad eagerly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Isn’t that a nice little thing? And I got two bills for you here.
I’ll hide those, though. Still, maybe you want to clear up all your
accounts. Some people like to get bills. The old lady next door wanted
to get hers. I gave her three and you’d think they were checks. Anyways,
these two don’t look very big, from the outside, anyhow. But of course
you can’t tell from the outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Let me see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Let me see them too.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>They squabble mildly over the bills.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> The thing is for everybody in the house to write what they guess
is the amount of the bill on the outside of the envelope, and then when
you open the envelope the one who guessed the closest has to pay the
bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Or he could get a prize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Something like that. [<i>He winks at Doris.</i>] And here’s a couple
of post-cards. They’re sort of pretty ones. This one’s&mdash;the Union
Station at Buffalo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Let me see it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> And this one says Xmas greetings. It’s four months late. [<i>To
Doris.</i>] I guess these are for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> No, they’re for my sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, I haven’t read what’s written on the back. I never do. I
hope it’s good news.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>inspecting the backs</i>]. No, they’re from an aunt or something.
Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Yes, here’s one more. I think it’s one of the neatest letters
I’ve had this morning. Now, isn’t that a cute letter? I call that a cute
letter. [<i>He weighs it in his hand and smells it.</i>] Smell it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It does smell good. It’s a perfume ad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Say, that sure does smell good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, I’ve done pretty well by <i>you</i> this morning. Maybe you got
a letter for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> No, there’s none to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Funny thing: I came near leaving that pink letter with a little
girl down the street who looked as if she needed one pretty bad. I
thought that maybe it was really meant for her, and just had the wrong
name<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span> and address on by mistake. It would of tickled her. I get tempted
to leave mail where it really ought to go instead of where it’s
addressed to. Mail ought to go to people who appreciate it. It’s hard on
a postman, especially when he’s the best one they ever had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I guess it must be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Yeah, it must be tough.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>They are both obviously fascinated.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Well, there’s somebody in this house who needs the right letter
something <i>aw</i>ful. If you get one that looks as if it might do for her
you could leave it by here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Is that so? Well, that’s too bad. I’ll certainly keep that in
mind. The next one I think’ll do, I’ll leave it by here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I’ve got one of these special delivery love-letters for a girl
around the corner, and I want to hurry up and give it to her, so as to
see her grin when she gets it. It’s for Miss Doris&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>interrupting</i>]. That’s me. Give it to me now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Sure. Say, this is lucky. [<i>He starts to hand it to her.</i>] Say,
listen&mdash;why are you like a stenographer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I don’t know. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Because I say to you, “Take a letter.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>wildly amused</i>]. Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>with some satisfaction</i>]. That’s a good one, isn’t it? I made
that one up this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Ha-ha! Ho-ho!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Joseph, I asked you to have some respect for the missing. [<i>To
Jerry.</i>] You see there’s a fella missing here and it’s his wife that
needs the letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> [<i>jealously</i>]. Who’s <i>your</i> letter from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris</span> [<i>reading it</i>]. It’s from my last fiancé. It says he didn’t mean
to drink the perfume, but the label was off the bottle and he thought it
was bay rum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> My God! Will you forgive him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Don’t worry, my boy. Bay rum or perfume, he killed her love with
the first swallow. [<i>He goes toward the door.</i>] Good-by. I’ll try to
find that letter for the lady here that needs it so bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Good-by&mdash;and thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> Let me open the door.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He opens the door. Jerry goes out. Doris and Fish stare at each
other.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> Isn’t he wonderful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> He’s a peach of a fella, but&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I know what you’re going to say; that you’ve seen him somewhere
before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> I’m trying to think where. Maybe he’s been in the movies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I think it’s that he looks like some fella I was engaged to once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> He’s <i>some</i> mailman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> The nicest one I ever saw. Isn’t he for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> By far. Say, Charlie Chaplin’s down at the Bijou.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> I don’t like him. I think he’s vulgar. Let’s go and see if
there’s anything artistic.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Fish makes an indistinguishable frightened noise.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish.</span> I’ve swallowed my gum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doris.</span> It ought to teach you a moral.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They go out. Charlotte comes in drearily. She glances first
eagerly, then listlessly at the letters and throws them aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Clin-ng! The door-bell. She starts violently, runs to open it. It
is that astounding product of our constitution, Mr. Snooks.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>in horror</i>]. Oh, what do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>affably</i>]. Good morning, lady. Is your husband around?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> No. What have you done with him, you beast!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Say, what’s biting you, lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> My husband was all right until you came here with that
poison! What have you done with him? Where is he? What did you give him
to drink? Tell me, or I’ll scream for the police! Tell me! Tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Lady, I ain’t seen your husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> You lie! You know my husband has run away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>interested</i>]. Say now, has he? I had a hunch he would, sooner
or later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> You made him. You told him to, that night, after I went out
of the room! You suggested it to him. He’d never have thought of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Lady, you got me wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Then where is he? If I’m wrong, find him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks</span> [<i>after a short consideration</i>]. Have you tried the morgue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Oh-h-h! Don’t say that word!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Oh, he ain’t in the morgue. Probably some Jane’s got hold of
him. She’ll send him home when she gets all his dough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> He isn’t a brute like you. He’s been kidnapped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Maybe he’s joined the Marine Corpse.... Howsoever, if he ain’t
here I guess I’ll be movin’ on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> What do you want of him now? Do you want to sell him some
more wood alcohol?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> Lady, I don’t handle no wood alcohol. But I found a way of
getting the grain alcohol out of iodine an’ practically eliminatin’ the
poison. Just leaves a faint brownish tinge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snooks.</span> All right. I’ll beat it.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>So he beats it.</i></p>

<p><i>Charlotte’s getting desperate from such encounters. With gathering
nervousness she wanders about the room, almost collapsing when she
comes upon one of Jerry’s coats hanging behind a door. Scarcely
aware of what she’s doing, she puts on the coat and buttons it
close, as if imagining that Jerry is holding her to him in the
brief and half-forgotten season of their honeymoon.</i></p>

<p><i>Outside a storm is come up. It has grown dark suddenly, and a
faint drum of thunder lengthens into a cataract of doom. A louder
rolling now and a great snake of lightning in the sky. Charlotte,
lonesome and frightened, hurriedly closes the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span>windows. Then, in
sudden panic, she runs to the ’phone.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Summit 3253.... Hello, this is me. This is Charlotte.... Is
Doris there? Do you know where she is?... Well, if she comes in tell her
to run over. Everything’s getting dark and I’m frightened.... Yes,
<i>may</i>be somebody’ll come in, but <i>no</i>body goes out in a storm like this.
Even the policeman on the corner has gotten under a tree.... Well, I’ll
be all right. I’m just lonesome, I guess, and scared.... Good-by.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She rings off and stands silently by the table. The storm reaches
its height. Simultaneously with a terrific burst of thunder that
sets the windows rattling the front door blows open suddenly,
letting in a heavy gust of rain.</i></p>

<p><i>Charlotte is on the verge of hysterics.</i></p>

<p><i>Then there is a whistle outside&mdash;the bright, mellow whistle of the
postman. She springs up, clasping her hands together. Jerry comes
in, covered with a rain cape dripping water. The hood of the cape
partially conceals his face.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> [<i>cheerfully</i>]. Well, it certainly is a rotten day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>starting at the voice</i>]. It’s awful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> But I heard there was a lady here that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span> expecting a letter,
and I had one that I thought’d do, so no rain or anything could keep me
from delivering it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>greedily</i>]. A letter for me? Let me have it.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>He hands it to her and she tears it open.</i></p></div>

<p>It’s from Jerry!</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>She reads it quickly.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Is it what you wanted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>aloud, but to herself</i>]. It doesn’t say where he is. It just
says that he’s well and comfortable. And that he’s doing what he wants
to do and what he’s got to do. And he says that doing his work makes him
happy. [<i>With suspicion.</i>] I wonder if he’s in some dive.... If I wrote
him a letter do you think you could find him with it, Mr. Postman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Yes, I can find him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I want to tell him that if he’ll come home I won’t nag him
any more, that I won’t try to change him, and that I won’t fuss at him
for being poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I’ll tell him that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>again talking to herself</i>]. I was trying to nag him <i>into</i>
something, I guess. Before we were married I always thought there must
be some sort of mysterious brave things he did when he wasn’t with me. I
thought that maybe sometimes he’d sneak away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span> hunt bears. But when
he’d sneak away it was just to roll dice for cigars down at the corner.
It wasn’t forests&mdash;it was just&mdash;toothpicks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Suppose that he was nothing but a postman now&mdash;like me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I’ll be proud of him if he’s a postman, because I know he
always wanted to be one. He’d be the best postman in the world and
there’s something kind of exciting about being the best. It wasn’t so
much that I wanted him to be rich, I guess, but I wanted him to do
something he wouldn’t always be beat at. I was sort of glad he got drunk
that night. It was about the first exciting thing he ever did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> You never would of told him that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>stiffening</i>]. I should say I wouldn’t of.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jerry rises.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I’ll try to get him here at six o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> I’ll be waiting. [<i>Quickly.</i>] Tell him to stop by a store and
get some rubbers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I’ll tell him. Good-by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> Good-by.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>Jerry goes out into the rain, Charlotte sits down and bows her
head upon the table.</i></p>

<p><i>Again there are steps on the porch. This time it is Dada, who
comes in, closing a dripping umbrella.</i></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada</span> [<i>as one who has passed through a great crisis</i>]. I borrowed an
umbrella from a man at the library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>in a muffled voice</i>]. Jerry’s coming back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Is he? A man at the library was kind enough to lend me his
umbrella. [<i>He goes over to the bookcase and begins an unsuccessful
search for the Scriptures. Plaintively</i>]. Some one has hidden my Bible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> In the second shelf.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He finds it. As he pulls it from its place, several other books
come with it and tumble to the floor. After a glance at Charlotte,
he kicks them under the bookcase. Then, with his Bible under his
arm, he starts for the stairs, but is attracted by something bright
on the first stair, and attempts, unsuccessfully, to pick it up.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dada.</span> Hello, here’s a nail that looks like a ten-cent piece.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes up-stairs. When he is half-way up, there is a sound as if
he had slipped back a notch, then silence.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> [<i>raising her head</i>]. Are you all right, Dada?</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p><i>No answer. Dada is heard to resume his climb.</i></p></div>

<p>Oh, if I could only sleep till six o’clock!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The storm has blown away, and the sun is out and streaming in the
window, washing the ragged carpet with light. From the street there
comes once again, faint now and far away, the mellow note of the
postman’s whistle.</i></p></div>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>The Beautiful and Damned’ confirms the impression made by his first
novel, ‘This Side of Paradise,’ that of the younger American novelists
he has the greatest natural talent. He has romance and imagination and a
gaiety unknown to most of the young moderns, who on the whole take a
sorry view of life; he is not darkly and deeply engaged with the sacred
mysteries of Eros; he has apparently a great facility in writing, and
often beauty and felicity of expression. But, above all, he is able to
tell a story, and does not need to resort to the strange substitutes
that often pass for fiction-writing nowadays.”</p>
